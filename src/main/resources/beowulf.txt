prelude of the founder of the danish house

lo praise of the prowess of people kings
of spear armed danes in days long sped
we have heard and what honor the athelings won
oft scyld the scefing from squadroned foes
from many a tribe the mead bench tore
awing the earls since erst he lay
friendless a foundling fate repaid him
for he waxed under welkin in wealth he throve
till before him the folk both far and near
who house by the whale path heard his mandate
gave him gifts  a good king he
to him an heir was afterward born
a son in his halls whom heaven sent
to favor the folk feeling their woe
that erst they had lacked an earl for leader
so long a while the lord endowed him
the wielder of wonder with world's renown
famed was this beowulf  {0a} far flew the boast of him
son of scyld in the scandian lands
so becomes it a youth to quit him well
with his father's friends by fee and gift
that to aid him aged in after days
come warriors willing should war draw nigh
liegemen loyal  by lauded deeds
shall an earl have honor in every clan

forth he fared at the fated moment
sturdy scyld to the shelter of god
then they bore him over to ocean's billow
loving clansmen as late he charged them
while wielded words the winsome scyld
the leader beloved who long had ruled
in the roadstead rocked a ring dight vessel
ice flecked outbound atheling's barge
there laid they down their darling lord
on the breast of the boat the breaker of rings {0b}
by the mast the mighty one many a treasure
fetched from far was freighted with him
no ship have i known so nobly dight
with weapons of war and weeds of battle
with breastplate and blade  on his bosom lay
a heaped hoard that hence should go
far o'er the flood with him floating away
no less these loaded the lordly gifts
thanes' huge treasure than those had done
who in former time forth had sent him
sole on the seas a suckling child
high o'er his head they hoist the standard
a gold wove banner let billows take him
gave him to ocean grave were their spirits
mournful their mood no man is able
to say in sooth no son of the halls
no hero 'neath heaven  who harbored that freight



now beowulf bode in the burg of the scyldings
leader beloved and long he ruled
in fame with all folk since his father had gone
away from the world till awoke an heir
haughty healfdene who held through life
sage and sturdy the scyldings glad
then one after one there woke to him
to the chieftain of clansmen children four
heorogar then hrothgar then halga brave
and i heard that  was  's queen
the heathoscylfing's helpmate dear
to hrothgar was given such glory of war
such honor of combat that all his kin
obeyed him gladly till great grew his band
of youthful comrades it came in his mind
to bid his henchmen a hall uprear
a master mead house mightier far
than ever was seen by the sons of earth
and within it then to old and young
he would all allot that the lord had sent him
save only the land and the lives of his men
wide i heard was the work commanded
for many a tribe this mid earth round
to fashion the folkstead it fell as he ordered
in rapid achievement that ready it stood there
of halls the noblest  heorot {1a} he named it
whose message had might in many a land
not reckless of promise the rings he dealt
treasure at banquet  there towered the hall
high gabled wide the hot surge waiting
of furious flame {1b} nor far was that day
when father and son in law stood in feud
for warfare and hatred that woke again {1c}
with envy and anger an evil spirit
endured the dole in his dark abode
that he heard each day the din of revel
high in the hall  there harps rang out
clear song of the singer he sang who knew {1d}
tales of the early time of man
how the almighty made the earth
fairest fields enfolded by water
set triumphant sun and moon
for a light to lighten the land dwellers
and braided bright the breast of earth
with limbs and leaves made life for all
of mortal beings that breathe and move
so lived the clansmen in cheer and revel
a winsome life till one began
to fashion evils that field of hell
grendel this monster grim was called
march riever {1e} mighty in moorland living
in fen and fastness fief of the giants
the hapless wight a while had kept
since the creator his exile doomed
on kin of cain was the killing avenged
by sovran god for slaughtered abel
ill fared his feud {1f} and far was he driven
for the slaughter's sake from sight of men
of cain awoke all that woful breed
etins {1g} and elves and evil spirits
as well as the giants that warred with god
weary while  but their wage was paid them



went he forth to find at fall of night
that haughty house and heed wherever
the ring danes outrevelled to rest had gone
found within it the atheling band
asleep after feasting and fearless of sorrow
of human hardship unhallowed wight
grim and greedy he grasped betimes
wrathful reckless from resting places
thirty of the thanes and thence he rushed
fain of his fell spoil faring homeward
laden with slaughter his lair to seek
then at the dawning as day was breaking
the might of grendel to men was known
then after wassail was wail uplifted
loud moan in the morn the mighty chief
atheling excellent unblithe sat
labored in woe for the loss of his thanes
when once had been traced the trail of the fiend
spirit accurst  too cruel that sorrow
too long too loathsome not late the respite
with night returning anew began
ruthless murder he recked no whit
firm in his guilt of the feud and crime
they were easy to find who elsewhere sought
in room remote their rest at night
bed in the bowers {2a} when that bale was shown
was seen in sooth with surest token
the hall thane's {2b} hate such held themselves
far and fast who the fiend outran
thus ruled unrighteous and raged his fill
one against all until empty stood
that lordly building and long it bode so
twelve years' tide the trouble he bore
sovran of scyldings sorrows in plenty
boundless cares there came unhidden
tidings true to the tribes of men
in sorrowful songs how ceaselessly grendel
harassed hrothgar what hate he bore him
what murder and massacre many a year
feud unfading  refused consent
to deal with any of daneland's earls
make pact of peace or compound for gold
still less did the wise men ween to get
great fee for the feud from his fiendish hands
but the evil one ambushed old and young
death shadow dark and dogged them still
lured or lurked in the livelong night
of misty moorlands  men may say not
where the haunts of these hell runes {2c} be
such heaping of horrors the hater of men
lonely roamer wrought unceasing
harassings heavy o'er heorot he lorded
gold bright hall in gloomy nights
and ne'er could the prince {2d} approach his throne
 'twas judgment of god  or have joy in his hall
sore was the sorrow to scyldings' friend
heart rending misery many nobles
sat assembled and searched out counsel
how it were best for bold hearted men
against harassing terror to try their hand
whiles they vowed in their heathen fanes
altar offerings asked with words {2e}
that the slayer of souls would succor give them
for the pain of their people their practice this
their heathen hope 'twas hell they thought of
in mood of their mind almighty they knew not
doomsman of deeds and dreadful lord
nor heaven's helmet heeded they ever
wielder of wonder  woe for that man
who in harm and hatred hales his soul
to fiery embraces  nor favor nor change
awaits he ever but well for him
that after death day may draw to his lord
and friendship find in the father's arms



thus seethed unceasing the son of healfdene
with the woe of these days not wisest men
assuaged his sorrow too sore the anguish
loathly and long that lay on his folk
most baneful of burdens and bales of the night

this heard in his home hygelac's thane
great among geats of grendel's doings
he was the mightiest man of valor
in that same day of this our life
stalwart and stately a stout wave walker
he bade make ready yon battle king said he
far o'er the swan road he fain would seek
the noble monarch who needed men
the prince's journey by prudent folk
was little blamed though they loved him dear
they whetted the hero and hailed good omens
and now the bold one from bands of geats
comrades chose the keenest of warriors
e'er he could find with fourteen men
the sea wood {3a} he sought and sailor proved
led them on to the land's confines
time had now flown {3b} afloat was the ship
boat under bluff on board they climbed
warriors ready waves were churning
sea with sand the sailors bore
on the breast of the bark their bright array
their mail and weapons  the men pushed off
on its willing way the well braced craft
then moved o'er the waters by might of the wind
that bark like a bird with breast of foam
till in season due on the second day
the curved prow such course had run
that sailors now could see the land
sea cliffs shining steep high hills
headlands broad their haven was found
their journey ended up then quickly
the weders' {3c} clansmen climbed ashore
anchored their sea wood with armor clashing
and gear of battle  god they thanked
or passing in peace o'er the paths of the sea
now saw from the cliff a scylding clansman
a warden that watched the water side
how they bore o'er the gangway glittering shields
war gear in readiness wonder seized him
to know what manner of men they were
straight to the strand his steed he rode
hrothgar's henchman with hand of might
he shook his spear and spake in parley
who are ye then ye armed men
mailed folk that yon mighty vessel
have urged thus over the ocean ways
here o'er the waters? a warden i
sentinel set o'er the sea march here
lest any foe to the folk of danes
with harrying fleet should harm the land
no aliens ever at ease thus bore them
linden wielders  {3d} yet word of leave
clearly ye lack from clansmen here
my folk's agreement  a greater ne'er saw i
of warriors in world than is one of you
yon hero in harness no henchman he
worthied by weapons if witness his features
his peerless presence i pray you though tell
your folk and home lest hence ye fare
suspect to wander your way as spies
in danish land now dwellers afar
ocean travellers take from me
simple advice  the sooner the better
i hear of the country whence ye came



to him the stateliest spake in answer
the warriors' leader his word hoard unlocked
we are by kin of the clan of geats
and hygelac's own hearth fellows we
to folk afar was my father known
noble atheling ecgtheow named
full of winters he fared away
aged from earth he is honored still
through width of the world by wise men all
to thy lord and liege in loyal mood
we hasten hither to healfdene's son
people protector  be pleased to advise us
to that mighty one come we on mickle errand
to the lord of the danes nor deem i right
that aught be hidden we hear  thou knowest
if sooth it is  the saying of men
that amid the scyldings a scathing monster
dark ill doer in dusky nights
shows terrific his rage unmatched
hatred and murder to hrothgar i
in greatness of soul would succor bring
so the wise and brave {4a} may worst his foes
if ever the end of ills is fated
of cruel contest if cure shall follow
and the boiling care waves cooler grow
else ever afterward anguish days
he shall suffer in sorrow while stands in place
high on its hill that house unpeered
astride his steed the strand ward answered
clansman unquailing  the keen souled thane
must be skilled to sever and sunder duly
words and works if he well intends
i gather this band is graciously bent
to the scyldings' master march then bearing
weapons and weeds the way i show you
i will bid my men your boat meanwhile
to guard for fear lest foemen come
your new tarred ship by shore of ocean
faithfully watching till once again
it waft o'er the waters those well loved thanes
 winding neck'd wood  to weders' bounds
heroes such as the hest of fate
shall succor and save from the shock of war
they bent them to march  the boat lay still
fettered by cable and fast at anchor
broad bosomed ship  then shone the boars {4b}
over the cheek guard chased with gold
keen and gleaming guard it kept
o'er the man of war as marched along
heroes in haste till the hall they saw
broad of gable and bright with gold
that was the fairest 'mid folk of earth
of houses 'neath heaven where hrothgar lived
and the gleam of it lightened o'er lands afar
the sturdy shieldsman showed that bright
burg of the boldest bade them go
straightway thither his steed then turned
hardy hero and hailed them thus
'tis time that i fare from you father almighty
in grace and mercy guard you well
safe in your seekings seaward i go
'gainst hostile warriors hold my watch



stone bright the street  {5a} it showed the way
to the crowd of clansmen corselets glistened
hand forged hard on their harness bright
the steel ring sang as they strode along
in mail of battle and marched to the hall
there weary of ocean the wall along
they set their bucklers their broad shields down
and bowed them to bench  the breastplates clanged
war gear of men their weapons stacked
spears of the seafarers stood together
gray tipped ash  that iron band
was worthily weaponed  a warrior proud
asked of the heroes their home and kin
whence now bear ye burnished shields
harness gray and helmets grim
spears in multitude? messenger i
hrothgar's herald heroes so many
ne'er met i as strangers of mood so strong
'tis plain that for prowess not plunged into exile
for high hearted valor hrothgar ye seek
him the sturdy in war bespake with words
proud earl of the weders answer made
hardy 'neath helmet   hygelac's we
fellows at board i am beowulf named
i am seeking to say to the son of healfdene
this mission of mine to thy master lord
the doughty prince if he deign at all
grace that we greet him the good one now
wulfgar spake the wendles' chieftain
whose might of mind to many was known
his courage and counsel  the king of danes
the scyldings' friend i fain will tell
the breaker of rings as the boon thou askest
the famed prince of thy faring hither
and swiftly after such answer bring
as the doughty monarch may deign to give
hied then in haste to where hrothgar sat
white haired and old his earls about him
till the stout thane stood at the shoulder there
of the danish king  good courtier he
wulfgar spake to his winsome lord
hither have fared to thee far come men
o'er the paths of ocean people of geatland
and the stateliest there by his sturdy band
is beowulf named this boon they seek
that they my master may with thee
have speech at will  nor spurn their prayer
to give them hearing gracious hrothgar
in weeds of the warrior worthy they
methinks of our liking their leader most surely
a hero that hither his henchmen has led



vi

hrothgar answered helmet of scyldings
i knew him of yore in his youthful days
his aged father was ecgtheow named
to whom at home gave hrethel the geat
his only daughter their offspring bold
fares hither to seek the steadfast friend
and seamen too have said me this
who carried my gifts to the geatish court
thither for thanks  he has thirty men's
heft of grasp in the gripe of his hand
the bold in battle blessed god
out of his mercy this man hath sent
to danes of the west as i ween indeed
against horror of grendel i hope to give
the good youth gold for his gallant thought
be thou in haste and bid them hither
clan of kinsmen to come before me
and add this word  they are welcome guests
to folk of the danes
[to the door of the hall
wulfgar went] and the word declared
to you this message my master sends
east danes' king that your kin he knows
hardy heroes and hails you all
welcome hither o'er waves of the sea
ye may wend your way in war attire
and under helmets hrothgar greet
but let here the battle shields bide your parley
and wooden war shafts wait its end
uprose the mighty one ringed with his men
brave band of thanes  some bode without
battle gear guarding as bade the chief
then hied that troop where the herald led them
under heorot's roof  [the hero strode]
hardy 'neath helm till the hearth he neared
beowulf spake  his breastplate gleamed
war net woven by wit of the smith
thou hrothgar hail hygelac's i
kinsman and follower fame a plenty
have i gained in youth these grendel deeds
i heard in my home land heralded clear
seafarers say how stands this hall
of buildings best for your band of thanes
empty and idle when evening sun
in the harbor of heaven is hidden away
so my vassals advised me well
brave and wise the best of men
o sovran hrothgar to seek thee here
for my nerve and my might they knew full well
themselves had seen me from slaughter come
blood flecked from foes where five i bound
and that wild brood worsted i' the waves i slew
nicors {6a} by night in need and peril
avenging the weders {6b} whose woe they sought
crushing the grim ones grendel now
monster cruel be mine to quell
in single battle so from thee
thou sovran of the shining danes
scyldings' bulwark a boon i seek
and friend of the folk refuse it not
o warriors' shield now i've wandered far
that i alone with my liegemen here
this hardy band may heorot purge
more i hear that the monster dire
in his wanton mood of weapons recks not
hence shall i scorn  so hygelac stay
king of my kindred kind to me
brand or buckler to bear in the fight
gold colored targe  but with gripe alone
must i front the fiend and fight for life
foe against foe then faith be his
in the doom of the lord whom death shall take
fain i ween if the fight he win
in this hall of gold my geatish band
will he fearless eat  as oft before
my noblest thanes nor need'st thou then
to hide my head {6c} for his shall i be
dyed in gore if death must take me
and my blood covered body he'll bear as prey
ruthless devour it the roamer lonely
with my life blood redden his lair in the fen
no further for me need'st food prepare
to hygelac send if hild {6d} should take me
best of war weeds warding my breast
armor excellent heirloom of hrethel
and work of wayland {6e} fares wyrd {6f} as she must



vii

hrothgar spake the scyldings' helmet
for fight defensive friend my beowulf
to succor and save thou hast sought us here
thy father's combat {7a} a feud enkindled
when heatholaf with hand he slew
among the wylfings his weder kin
for horror of fighting feared to hold him
fleeing he sought our south dane folk
over surge of ocean the honor scyldings
when first i was ruling the folk of danes
wielded youthful this widespread realm
this hoard hold of heroes heorogar was dead
my elder brother had breathed his last
healfdene's bairn  he was better than i
straightway the feud with fee {7b} i settled
to the wylfings sent o'er watery ridges
treasures olden  oaths he {7c} swore me
sore is my soul to say to any
of the race of man what ruth for me
in heorot grendel with hate hath wrought
what sudden harryings hall folk fail me
my warriors wane for wyrd hath swept them
into grendel's grasp but god is able
this deadly foe from his deeds to turn
boasted full oft as my beer they drank
earls o'er the ale cup armed men
that they would bide in the beer hall here
grendel's attack with terror of blades
then was this mead house at morning tide
dyed with gore when the daylight broke
all the boards of the benches blood besprinkled
gory the hall  i had heroes the less
doughty dear ones that death had reft
 but sit to the banquet unbind thy words
hardy hero as heart shall prompt thee

gathered together the geatish men
in the banquet hall on bench assigned
sturdy spirited sat them down
hardy hearted a henchman attended
carried the carven cup in hand
served the clear mead oft minstrels sang
blithe in heorot heroes revelled
no dearth of warriors weder and dane



viii

unferth spake the son of ecglaf
who sat at the feet of the scyldings' lord
unbound the battle runes {8a}  beowulf's quest
sturdy seafarer's sorely galled him
ever he envied that other men
should more achieve in middle earth
of fame under heaven than he himself
art thou that beowulf breca's rival
who emulous swam on the open sea
when for pride the pair of you proved the floods
and wantonly dared in waters deep
to risk your lives? no living man
or lief or loath from your labor dire
could you dissuade from swimming the main
ocean tides with your arms ye covered
with strenuous hands the sea streets measured
swam o'er the waters winter's storm
rolled the rough waves in realm of sea
a sennight strove ye in swimming he topped thee
had more of main him at morning tide
billows bore to the battling reamas
whence he hied to his home so dear
beloved of his liegemen to land of brondings
fastness fair where his folk he ruled
town and treasure in triumph o'er thee
beanstan's bairn {8b} his boast achieved
so ween i for thee a worse adventure
 though in buffet of battle thou brave hast been
in struggle grim  if grendel's approach
thou darst await through the watch of night

beowulf spake bairn of ecgtheow
what a deal hast uttered dear my unferth
drunken with beer of breca now
told of his triumph truth i claim it
that i had more of might in the sea
than any man else more ocean endurance
we twain had talked in time of youth
and made our boast  we were merely boys
striplings still  to stake our lives
far at sea  and so we performed it
naked swords as we swam along
we held in hand with hope to guard us
against the whales not a whit from me
could he float afar o'er the flood of waves
haste o'er the billows nor him i abandoned
together we twain on the tides abode
five nights full till the flood divided us
churning waves and chillest weather
darkling night and the northern wind
ruthless rushed on us  rough was the surge
now the wrath of the sea fish rose apace
yet me 'gainst the monsters my mailed coat
hard and hand linked help afforded
battle sark braided my breast to ward
garnished with gold there grasped me firm
and haled me to bottom the hated foe
with grimmest gripe 'twas granted me though
to pierce the monster with point of sword
with blade of battle  huge beast of the sea
was whelmed by the hurly through hand of mine



ix

me thus often the evil monsters
thronging threatened with thrust of my sword
the darling i dealt them due return
nowise had they bliss from their booty then
to devour their victim vengeful creatures
seated to banquet at bottom of sea
but at break of day by my brand sore hurt
on the edge of ocean up they lay
put to sleep by the sword and since by them
on the fathomless sea ways sailor folk
are never molested  light from east
came bright god's beacon the billows sank
so that i saw the sea cliffs high
windy walls for wyrd oft saveth
earl undoomed if he doughty be
and so it came that i killed with my sword
nine of the nicors of night fought battles
ne'er heard i a harder 'neath heaven's dome
nor adrift on the deep a more desolate man
yet i came unharmed from that hostile clutch
though spent with swimming the sea upbore me
flood of the tide on finnish land
the welling waters no wise of thee
have i heard men tell such terror of falchions
bitter battle breca ne'er yet
not one of you pair in the play of war
such daring deed has done at all
with bloody brand  i boast not of it
though thou wast the bane {9a} of thy brethren dear
thy closest kin whence curse of hell
awaits thee well as thy wit may serve
for i say in sooth thou son of ecglaf
never had grendel these grim deeds wrought
monster dire on thy master dear
in heorot such havoc if heart of thine
were as battle bold as thy boast is loud
but he has found no feud will happen
from sword clash dread of your danish clan
he vaunts him safe from the victor scyldings
he forces pledges favors none
of the land of danes but lustily murders
fights and feasts nor feud he dreads
from spear dane men but speedily now
shall i prove him the prowess and pride of the geats
shall bid him battle blithe to mead
go he that listeth when light of dawn
this morrow morning o'er men of earth
ether robed sun from the south shall beam
joyous then was the jewel giver
hoar haired war brave help awaited
the bright danes' prince from beowulf hearing
folk's good shepherd such firm resolve
then was laughter of liegemen loud resounding
with winsome words came wealhtheow forth
queen of hrothgar heedful of courtesy
gold decked greeting the guests in hall
and the high born lady handed the cup
first to the east danes' heir and warden
bade him be blithe at the beer carouse
the land's beloved one lustily took he
banquet and beaker battle famed king

through the hall then went the helmings' lady
to younger and older everywhere
carried the cup till come the moment
when the ring graced queen the royal hearted
to beowulf bore the beaker of mead
she greeted the geats' lord god she thanked
in wisdom's words that her will was granted
that at last on a hero her hope could lean
for comfort in terrors the cup he took
hardy in war from wealhtheow's hand
and answer uttered the eager for combat
beowulf spake bairn of ecgtheow
this was my thought when my thanes and i
bent to the ocean and entered our boat
that i would work the will of your people
fully or fighting fall in death
in fiend's gripe fast i am firm to do
an earl's brave deed or end the days
of this life of mine in the mead hall here
well these words to the woman seemed
beowulf's battle boast  bright with gold
the stately dame by her spouse sat down
again as erst began in hall
warriors' wassail and words of power
the proud band's revel till presently
the son of healfdene hastened to seek
rest for the night he knew there waited
fight for the fiend in that festal hall
when the sheen of the sun they saw no more
and dusk of night sank darkling nigh
and shadowy shapes came striding on
wan under welkin the warriors rose
man to man he made harangue
hrothgar to beowulf bade him hail
let him wield the wine hall  a word he added
never to any man erst i trusted
since i could heave up hand and shield
this noble dane hall till now to thee
have now and hold this house unpeered
remember thy glory thy might declare
watch for the foe no wish shall fail thee
if thou bidest the battle with bold won life



x

then hrothgar went with his hero train
defence of scyldings forth from hall
fain would the war lord wealhtheow seek
couch of his queen the king of glory
against this grendel a guard had set
so heroes heard a hall defender
who warded the monarch and watched for the monster
in truth the geats' prince gladly trusted
his mettle his might the mercy of god
cast off then his corselet of iron
helmet from head to his henchman gave
choicest of weapons  the well chased sword
bidding him guard the gear of battle
spake then his vaunt the valiant man
beowulf geat ere the bed be sought
of force in fight no feebler i count me
in grim war deeds than grendel deems him
not with the sword then to sleep of death
his life will i give though it lie in my power
no skill is his to strike against me
my shield to hew though he hardy be
bold in battle we both this night
shall spurn the sword if he seek me here
unweaponed for war let wisest god
sacred lord on which side soever
doom decree as he deemeth right
reclined then the chieftain and cheek pillows held
the head of the earl while all about him
seamen hardy on hall beds sank
none of them thought that thence their steps
to the folk and fastness that fostered them
to the land they loved would lead them back
full well they wist that on warriors many
battle death seized in the banquet hall
of danish clan but comfort and help
war weal weaving to weder folk
the master gave that by might of one
over their enemy all prevailed
by single strength in sooth 'tis told
that highest god o'er human kind
hath wielded ever  thro' wan night striding
came the walker in shadow warriors slept
whose hest was to guard the gabled hall
all save one 'twas widely known
that against god's will the ghostly ravager
him {10a} could not hurl to haunts of darkness
wakeful ready with warrior's wrath
bold he bided the battle's issue



xi

then from the moorland by misty crags
with god's wrath laden grendel came
the monster was minded of mankind now
sundry to seize in the stately house
under welkin he walked till the wine palace there
gold hall of men he gladly discerned
flashing with fretwork not first time this
that he the home of hrothgar sought
yet ne'er in his life day late or early
such hardy heroes such hall thanes found
to the house the warrior walked apace
parted from peace {11a} the portal opended
though with forged bolts fast when his fists had
struck it
and baleful he burst in his blatant rage
the house's mouth all hastily then
o'er fair paved floor the fiend trod on
ireful he strode there streamed from his eyes
fearful flashes like flame to see

he spied in hall the hero band
kin and clansmen clustered asleep
hardy liegemen then laughed his heart
for the monster was minded ere morn should dawn
savage to sever the soul of each
life from body since lusty banquet
waited his will but wyrd forbade him
to seize any more of men on earth
after that evening eagerly watched
hygelac's kinsman his cursed foe
how he would fare in fell attack
not that the monster was minded to pause
straightway he seized a sleeping warrior
for the first and tore him fiercely asunder
the bone frame bit drank blood in streams
swallowed him piecemeal  swiftly thus
the lifeless corse was clear devoured
e'en feet and hands then farther he hied
for the hardy hero with hand he grasped
felt for the foe with fiendish claw
for the hero reclining  who clutched it boldly
prompt to answer propped on his arm
soon then saw that shepherd of evils
that never he met in this middle world
in the ways of earth another wight
with heavier hand gripe at heart he feared
sorrowed in soul  none the sooner escaped
fain would he flee his fastness seek
the den of devils  no doings now
such as oft he had done in days of old
then bethought him the hardy hygelac thane
of his boast at evening  up he bounded
grasped firm his foe whose fingers cracked
the fiend made off but the earl close followed
the monster meant  if he might at all
to fling himself free and far away
fly to the fens  knew his fingers' power
in the gripe of the grim one gruesome march
to heorot this monster of harm had made
din filled the room the danes were bereft
castle dwellers and clansmen all
earls of their ale angry were both
those savage hall guards  the house resounded
wonder it was the wine hall firm
in the strain of their struggle stood to earth
the fair house fell not too fast it was
within and without by its iron bands
craftily clamped though there crashed from sill
many a mead bench  men have told me
gay with gold where the grim foes wrestled
so well had weened the wisest scyldings
that not ever at all might any man
that bone decked brave house break asunder
crush by craft  unless clasp of fire
in smoke engulfed it  again uprose
din redoubled danes of the north
with fear and frenzy were filled each one
who from the wall that wailing heard
god's foe sounding his grisly song
cry of the conquered clamorous pain
from captive of hell too closely held him
he who of men in might was strongest
in that same day of this our life



xii

not in any wise would the earls' defence {12a}
suffer that slaughterous stranger to live
useless deeming his days and years
to men on earth now many an earl
of beowulf brandished blade ancestral
fain the life of their lord to shield
their praised prince if power were theirs
never they knew  as they neared the foe
hardy hearted heroes of war
aiming their swords on every side
the accursed to kill  no keenest blade
no farest of falchions fashioned on earth
could harm or hurt that hideous fiend
he was safe by his spells from sword of battle
from edge of iron yet his end and parting
on that same day of this our life
woful should be and his wandering soul
far off flit to the fiends' domain
soon he found who in former days
harmful in heart and hated of god
on many a man such murder wrought
that the frame of his body failed him now
for him the keen souled kinsman of hygelac
held in hand hateful alive
was each to other the outlaw dire
took mortal hurt a mighty wound
showed on his shoulder and sinews cracked
and the bone frame burst to beowulf now
the glory was given and grendel thence
death sick his den in the dark moor sought
noisome abode  he knew too well
that here was the last of life an end
of his days on earth  to all the danes
by that bloody battle the boon had come
from ravage had rescued the roving stranger
hrothgar's hall the hardy and wise one
had purged it anew his night work pleased him
his deed and its honor to eastern danes
had the valiant geat his vaunt made good
all their sorrow and ills assuaged
their bale of battle borne so long
and all the dole they erst endured
pain a plenty  'twas proof of this
when the hardy in fight a hand laid down
arm and shoulder  all indeed
of grendel's gripe  'neath the gabled roof



xiii

many at morning as men have told me
warriors gathered the gift hall round
folk leaders faring from far and near
o'er wide stretched ways the wonder to view
trace of the traitor not troublous seemed
the enemy's end to any man
who saw by the gait of the graceless foe
how the weary hearted away from thence
baffled in battle and banned his steps
death marked dragged to the devils' mere
bloody the billows were boiling there
turbid the tide of tumbling waves
horribly seething with sword blood hot
by that doomed one dyed who in den of the moor
laid forlorn his life adown
his heathen soul and hell received it
home then rode the hoary clansmen
from that merry journey and many a youth
on horses white the hardy warriors
back from the mere then beowulf's glory
eager they echoed and all averred
that from sea to sea or south or north
there was no other in earth's domain
under vault of heaven more valiant found
of warriors none more worthy to rule
(on their lord beloved they laid no slight
gracious hrothgar  a good king he)
from time to time the tried in battle
their gray steeds set to gallop amain
and ran a race when the road seemed fair
from time to time a thane of the king
who had made many vaunts and was mindful of verses
stored with sagas and songs of old
bound word to word in well knit rime
welded his lay this warrior soon
of beowulf's quest right cleverly sang
and artfully added an excellent tale
in well ranged words of the warlike deeds
he had heard in saga of sigemund
strange the story  he said it all
the waelsing's wanderings wide his struggles
which never were told to tribes of men
the feuds and the frauds save to fitela only
when of these doings he deigned to speak
uncle to nephew as ever the twain
stood side by side in stress of war
and multitude of the monster kind
they had felled with their swords of sigemund grew
when he passed from life no little praise
for the doughty in combat a dragon killed
that herded the hoard  {13a} under hoary rock
the atheling dared the deed alone
fearful quest nor was fitela there
yet so it befell his falchion pierced
that wondrous worm  on the wall it struck
best blade the dragon died in its blood
thus had the dread one by daring achieved
over the ring hoard to rule at will
himself to pleasure a sea boat he loaded
and bore on its bosom the beaming gold
son of waels the worm was consumed
he had of all heroes the highest renown
among races of men this refuge of warriors
for deeds of daring that decked his name
since the hand and heart of heremod
grew slack in battle he swiftly banished
to mingle with monsters at mercy of foes
to death was betrayed for torrents of sorrow
had lamed him too long a load of care
to earls and athelings all he proved
oft indeed in earlier days
for the warrior's wayfaring wise men mourned
who had hoped of him help from harm and bale
and had thought their sovran's son would thrive
follow his father his folk protect
the hoard and the stronghold heroes' land
home of scyldings  but here thanes said
the kinsman of hygelac kinder seemed
to all  the other {13b} was urged to crime
and afresh to the race {13c} the fallow roads
by swift steeds measured the morning sun
was climbing higher clansmen hastened
to the high built hall those hardy minded
the wonder to witness warden of treasure
crowned with glory the king himself
with stately band from the bride bower strode
and with him the queen and her crowd of maidens
measured the path to the mead house fair



xiv

hrothgar spake  to the hall he went
stood by the steps the steep roof saw
garnished with gold and grendel's hand
for the sight i see to the sovran ruler
be speedy thanks a throng of sorrows
i have borne from grendel but god still works
wonder on wonder the warden of glory
it was but now that i never more
for woes that weighed on me waited help
long as i lived when laved in blood
stood sword gore stained this stateliest house
widespread woe for wise men all
who had no hope to hinder ever
foes infernal and fiendish sprites
from havoc in hall this hero now
by the wielder's might a work has done
that not all of us erst could ever do
by wile and wisdom lo well can she say
whoso of women this warrior bore
among sons of men if still she liveth
that the god of the ages was good to her
in the birth of her bairn now beowulf thee
of heroes best i shall heartily love
as mine own my son preserve thou ever
this kinship new  thou shalt never lack
wealth of the world that i wield as mine
full oft for less have i largess showered
my precious hoard on a punier man
less stout in struggle thyself hast now
fulfilled such deeds that thy fame shall endure
through all the ages as ever he did
well may the wielder reward thee still
beowulf spake bairn of ecgtheow
this work of war most willingly
we have fought this fight and fearlessly dared
force of the foe fain too were i
hadst thou but seen himself what time
the fiend in his trappings tottered to fall
swiftly i thought in strongest gripe
on his bed of death to bind him down
that he in the hent of this hand of mine
should breathe his last  but he broke away
him i might not  the maker willed not
hinder from flight and firm enough hold
the life destroyer  too sturdy was he
the ruthless in running for rescue however
he left behind him his hand in pledge
arm and shoulder nor aught of help
could the cursed one thus procure at all
none the longer liveth he loathsome fiend
sunk in his sins but sorrow holds him
tightly grasped in gripe of anguish
in baleful bonds where bide he must
evil outlaw such awful doom
as the mighty maker shall mete him out

more silent seemed the son of ecglaf {14a}
in boastful speech of his battle deeds
since athelings all through the earl's great prowess
beheld that hand on the high roof gazing
foeman's fingers  the forepart of each
of the sturdy nails to steel was likest
heathen's hand spear hostile warrior's
claw uncanny 'twas clear they said
that him no blade of the brave could touch
how keen soever or cut away
that battle hand bloody from baneful foe



xv

there was hurry and hest in heorot now
for hands to bedeck it and dense was the throng
of men and women the wine hall to cleanse
the guest room to garnish gold gay shone the hangings
that were wove on the wall and wonders many
to delight each mortal that looks upon them
though braced within by iron bands
that building bright was broken sorely {15a}
rent were its hinges the roof alone
held safe and sound when seared with crime
the fiendish foe his flight essayed
of life despairing  no light thing that
the flight for safety  essay it who will
forced of fate he shall find his way
to the refuge ready for race of man
for soul possessors and sons of earth
and there his body on bed of death
shall rest after revel
arrived was the hour
when to hall proceeded healfdene's son
the king himself would sit to banquet
ne'er heard i of host in haughtier throng
more graciously gathered round giver of rings
bowed then to bench those bearers of glory
fain of the feasting featly received
many a mead cup the mighty in spirit
kinsmen who sat in the sumptuous hall
hrothgar and hrothulf heorot now
was filled with friends the folk of scyldings
ne'er yet had tried the traitor's deed
to beowulf gave the bairn of healfdene
a gold wove banner guerdon of triumph
broidered battle flag breastplate and helmet
and a splendid sword was seen of many
borne to the brave one beowulf took
cup in hall  {15b} for such costly gifts
he suffered no shame in that soldier throng
for i heard of few heroes in heartier mood
with four such gifts so fashioned with gold
on the ale bench honoring others thus
o'er the roof of the helmet high a ridge
wound with wires kept ward o'er the head
lest the relict of files {15c} should fierce invade
sharp in the strife when that shielded hero
should go to grapple against his foes
then the earls' defence {15d} on the floor {15e} bade lead
coursers eight with carven head gear
adown the hall  one horse was decked
with a saddle all shining and set in jewels
'twas the battle seat of the best of kings
when to play of swords the son of healfdene
was fain to fare ne'er failed his valor
in the crush of combat when corpses fell
to beowulf over them both then gave
the refuge of ingwines right and power
o'er war steeds and weapons  wished him joy of them
manfully thus the mighty prince
hoard guard for heroes that hard fight repaid
with steeds and treasures contemned by none
who is willing to say the sooth aright



xvi

and the lord of earls to each that came
with beowulf over the briny ways
an heirloom there at the ale bench gave
precious gift and the price {16a} bade pay
in gold for him whom grendel erst
murdered  and fain of them more had killed
had not wisest god their wyrd averted
and the man's {16b} brave mood the maker then
ruled human kind as here and now
therefore is insight always best
and forethought of mind how much awaits him
of lief and of loath who long time here
through days of warfare this world endures

then song and music mingled sounds
in the presence of healfdene's head of armies {16c}
and harping was heard with the hero lay
as hrothgar's singer the hall joy woke
along the mead seats making his song
of that sudden raid on the sons of finn {16d}
healfdene's hero hnaef the scylding
was fated to fall in the frisian slaughter {16e}
hildeburh needed not hold in value
her enemies' honor {16f} innocent both
were the loved ones she lost at the linden play
bairn and brother they bowed to fate
stricken by spears 'twas a sorrowful woman
none doubted why the daughter of hoc
bewailed her doom when dawning came
and under the sky she saw them lying
kinsmen murdered where most she had kenned
of the sweets of the world by war were swept too
finn's own liegemen and few were left
in the parleying place {16g} he could ply no longer
weapon nor war could he wage on hengest
and rescue his remnant by right of arms
from the prince's thane a pact he offered
another dwelling the danes should have
hall and high seat and half the power
should fall to them in frisian land
and at the fee gifts folcwald's son
day by day the danes should honor
the folk of hengest favor with rings
even as truly with treasure and jewels
with fretted gold as his frisian kin
he meant to honor in ale hall there
pact of peace they plighted further
on both sides firmly finn to hengest
with oath upon honor openly promised
that woful remnant with wise men's aid
nobly to govern so none of the guests
by word or work should warp the treaty {16h}
or with malice of mind bemoan themselves
as forced to follow their fee giver's slayer
lordless men as their lot ordained
should frisian moreover with foeman's taunt
that murderous hatred to mind recall
then edge of the sword must seal his doom

oaths were given and ancient gold
heaped from hoard  the hardy scylding
battle thane best {16i} on his balefire lay
all on the pyre were plain to see
the gory sark the gilded swine crest
boar of hard iron and athelings many
slain by the sword  at the slaughter they fell
it was hildeburh's hest at hnaef's own pyre
the bairn of her body on brands to lay
his bones to burn on the balefire placed
at his uncle's side in sorrowful dirges
bewept them the woman  great wailing ascended
then wound up to welkin the wildest of death fires
roared o'er the hillock  {16j} heads all were melted
gashes burst and blood gushed out
from bites {16k} of the body balefire devoured
greediest spirit those spared not by war
out of either folk  their flower was gone



xvii

then hastened those heroes their home to see
friendless to find the frisian land
houses and high burg hengest still
through the death dyed winter dwelt with finn
holding pact yet of home he minded
though powerless his ring decked prow to drive
over the waters now waves rolled fierce
lashed by the winds or winter locked them
in icy fetters then fared another
year to men's dwellings as yet they do
the sunbright skies that their season ever
duly await far off winter was driven
fair lay earth's breast and fain was the rover
the guest to depart though more gladly he pondered
on wreaking his vengeance than roaming the deep
and how to hasten the hot encounter
where sons of the frisians were sure to be
so he escaped not the common doom
when hun with lafing the light of battle
best of blades his bosom pierced
its edge was famed with the frisian earls
on fierce heart finn there fell likewise
on himself at home the horrid sword death
for guthlaf and oslaf of grim attack
had sorrowing told from sea ways landed
mourning their woes {17a} finn's wavering spirit
bode not in breast the burg was reddened
with blood of foemen and finn was slain
king amid clansmen the queen was taken
to their ship the scylding warriors bore
all the chattels the chieftain owned
whatever they found in finn's domain
of gems and jewels the gentle wife
o'er paths of the deep to the danes they bore
led to her land
the lay was finished
the gleeman's song then glad rose the revel
bench joy brightened bearers draw
from their wonder vats wine comes wealhtheow forth
under gold crown goes where the good pair sit
uncle and nephew true each to the other one
kindred in amity unferth the spokesman
at the scylding lord's feet sat  men had faith in his spirit
his keenness of courage though kinsmen had found him
unsure at the sword play the scylding queen spoke
quaff of this cup my king and lord
breaker of rings and blithe be thou
gold friend of men to the geats here speak
such words of mildness as man should use
be glad with thy geats of those gifts be mindful
or near or far which now thou hast

men say to me as son thou wishest
yon hero to hold thy heorot purged
jewel hall brightest enjoy while thou canst
with many a largess and leave to thy kin
folk and realm when forth thou goest
to greet thy doom for gracious i deem
my hrothulf {17b} willing to hold and rule
nobly our youths if thou yield up first
prince of scyldings thy part in the world
i ween with good he will well requite
offspring of ours when all he minds
that for him we did in his helpless days
of gift and grace to gain him honor
then she turned to the seat where her sons wereplaced
hrethric and hrothmund with heroes' bairns
young men together  the geat too sat there
beowulf brave the brothers between



xviii

a cup she gave him with kindly greeting
and winsome words of wounden gold
she offered to honor him arm jewels twain
corselet and rings and of collars the noblest
that ever i knew the earth around
ne'er heard i so mighty 'neath heaven's dome
a hoard gem of heroes since hama bore
to his bright built burg the brisings' necklace
jewel and gem casket  jealousy fled he
eormenric's hate  chose help eternal
hygelac geat grandson of swerting
on the last of his raids this ring bore with him
under his banner the booty defending
the war spoil warding but wyrd o'erwhelmed him
what time in his daring dangers he sought
feud with frisians fairest of gems
he bore with him over the beaker of waves
sovran strong  under shield he died
fell the corpse of the king into keeping of franks
gear of the breast and that gorgeous ring
weaker warriors won the spoil
after gripe of battle from geatland's lord
and held the death field
din rose in hall
wealhtheow spake amid warriors and said
this jewel enjoy in thy jocund youth
beowulf lov'd these battle weeds wear
a royal treasure and richly thrive
preserve thy strength and these striplings here
counsel in kindness  requital be mine
hast done such deeds that for days to come
thou art famed among folk both far and near
so wide as washeth the wave of ocean
his windy walls through the ways of life
prosper o prince i pray for thee
rich possessions to son of mine
be helpful in deed and uphold his joys
here every earl to the other is true
mild of mood to the master loyal
thanes are friendly the throng obedient
liegemen are revelling  list and obey
went then to her place  that was proudest of feasts
flowed wine for the warriors wyrd they knew not
destiny dire and the doom to be seen
by many an earl when eve should come
and hrothgar homeward hasten away
royal to rest the room was guarded
by an army of earls as erst was done
they bared the bench boards abroad they spread
beds and bolsters  one beer carouser
in danger of doom lay down in the hall

at their heads they set their shields of war
bucklers bright on the bench were there
over each atheling easy to see
the high battle helmet the haughty spear
the corselet of rings 'twas their custom so
ever to be for battle prepared
at home or harrying which it were
even as oft as evil threatened
their sovran king  they were clansmen good



xix

then sank they to sleep with sorrow one bought
his rest of the evening  as ofttime had happened
when grendel guarded that golden hall
evil wrought till his end drew nigh
slaughter for sins 'twas seen and told
how an avenger survived the fiend
as was learned afar the livelong time
after that grim fight grendel's mother
monster of women mourned her woe
she was doomed to dwell in the dreary waters
cold sea courses since cain cut down
with edge of the sword his only brother
his father's offspring  outlawed he fled
marked with murder from men's delights
warded the wilds  there woke from him
such fate sent ghosts as grendel who
war wolf horrid at heorot found
a warrior watching and waiting the fray
with whom the grisly one grappled amain
but the man remembered his mighty power
the glorious gift that god had sent him
in his maker's mercy put his trust
for comfort and help  so he conquered the foe
felled the fiend who fled abject
reft of joy to the realms of death
mankind's foe and his mother now
gloomy and grim would go that quest
of sorrow the death of her son to avenge
to heorot came she where helmeted danes
slept in the hall too soon came back
old ills of the earls when in she burst
the mother of grendel less grim though that terror
e'en as terror of woman in war is less
might of maid than of men in arms
when hammer forged the falchion hard
sword gore stained through swine of the helm
crested with keen blade carves amain
then was in hall the hard edge drawn
the swords on the settles {19a} and shields a many
firm held in hand  nor helmet minded
nor harness of mail whom that horror seized
haste was hers she would hie afar
and save her life when the liegemen saw her
yet a single atheling up she seized
fast and firm as she fled to the moor
he was for hrothgar of heroes the dearest
of trusty vassals betwixt the seas
whom she killed on his couch a clansman famous
in battle brave  nor was beowulf there
another house had been held apart
after giving of gold for the geat renowned
uproar filled heorot the hand all had viewed
blood flecked she bore with her bale was returned
dole in the dwellings  'twas dire exchange
where dane and geat were doomed to give
the lives of loved ones long tried king
the hoary hero at heart was sad
when he knew his noble no more lived
and dead indeed was his dearest thane
to his bower was beowulf brought in haste
dauntless victor as daylight broke
along with his earls the atheling lord
with his clansmen came where the king abode
waiting to see if the wielder of all
would turn this tale of trouble and woe
strode o'er floor the famed in strife
with his hand companions  the hall resounded
wishing to greet the wise old king
ingwines' lord he asked if the night
had passed in peace to the prince's mind





hrothgar spake helmet of scyldings
ask not of pleasure pain is renewed
to danish folk dead is aeschere
of yrmenlaf the elder brother
my sage adviser and stay in council
shoulder comrade in stress of fight
when warriors clashed and we warded our heads
hewed the helm boars hero famed
should be every earl as aeschere was
but here in heorot a hand hath slain him
of wandering death sprite i wot not whither {20a}
proud of the prey her path she took
fain of her fill the feud she avenged
that yesternight unyieldingly
grendel in grimmest grasp thou killedst
seeing how long these liegemen mine
he ruined and ravaged reft of life
in arms he fell now another comes
keen and cruel her kin to avenge
faring far in feud of blood
so that many a thane shall think who e'er
sorrows in soul for that sharer of rings
this is hardest of heart bales the hand lies low
that once was willing each wish to please
land dwellers here {20b} and liegemen mine
who house by those parts i have heard relate
that such a pair they have sometimes seen
march stalkers mighty the moorland haunting
wandering spirits  one of them seemed
so far as my folk could fairly judge
of womankind and one accursed
in man's guise trod the misery track
of exile though huger than human bulk
grendel in days long gone they named him
folk of the land his father they knew not
nor any brood that was born to him
of treacherous spirits untrod is their home
by wolf cliffs haunt they and windy headlands
fenways fearful where flows the stream
from mountains gliding to gloom of the rocks
underground flood not far is it hence
in measure of miles that the mere expands
and o'er it the frost bound forest hanging
sturdily rooted shadows the wave
by night is a wonder weird to see
fire on the waters so wise lived none
of the sons of men to search those depths
nay though the heath rover harried by dogs
the horn proud hart this holt should seek
long distance driven his dear life first
on the brink he yields ere he brave the plunge
to hide his head  'tis no happy place
thence the welter of waters washes up
wan to welkin when winds bestir
evil storms and air grows dusk
and the heavens weep now is help once more
with thee alone the land thou knowst not
place of fear where thou findest out
that sin flecked being seek if thou dare
i will reward thee for waging this fight
with ancient treasure as erst i did
with winding gold if thou winnest back





beowulf spake bairn of ecgtheow
sorrow not sage it beseems us better
friends to avenge than fruitlessly mourn them
each of us all must his end abide
in the ways of the world so win who may
glory ere death when his days are told
that is the warrior's worthiest doom
rise o realm warder ride we anon
and mark the trail of the mother of grendel
no harbor shall hide her  heed my promise
enfolding of field or forested mountain
or floor of the flood let her flee where she will
but thou this day endure in patience
as i ween thou wilt thy woes each one
leaped up the graybeard  god he thanked
mighty lord for the man's brave words
for hrothgar soon a horse was saddled
wave maned steed the sovran wise
stately rode on his shield armed men
followed in force the footprints led
along the woodland widely seen
a path o'er the plain where she passed and trod
the murky moor of men at arms
she bore the bravest and best one dead
him who with hrothgar the homestead ruled
on then went the atheling born
o'er stone cliffs steep and strait defiles
narrow passes and unknown ways
headlands sheer and the haunts of the nicors
foremost he {21a} fared a few at his side
of the wiser men the ways to scan
till he found in a flash the forested hill
hanging over the hoary rock
a woful wood  the waves below
were dyed in blood the danish men
had sorrow of soul and for scyldings all
for many a hero 'twas hard to bear
ill for earls when aeschere's head
they found by the flood on the foreland there
waves were welling the warriors saw
hot with blood but the horn sang oft
battle song bold the band sat down
and watched on the water worm like things
sea dragons strange that sounded the deep
and nicors that lay on the ledge of the ness
such as oft essay at hour of morn
on the road of sails their ruthless quest
and sea snakes and monsters these started away
swollen and savage that song to hear
that war horn's blast the warden of geats
with bolt from bow then balked of life
of wave work one monster amid its heart
went the keen war shaft in water it seemed
less doughty in swimming whom death had seized
swift on the billows with boar spears well
hooked and barbed it was hard beset
done to death and dragged on the headland
wave roamer wondrous warriors viewed
the grisly guest
then girt him beowulf
in martial mail nor mourned for his life
his breastplate broad and bright of hues
woven by hand should the waters try
well could it ward the warrior's body
that battle should break on his breast in vain
nor harm his heart by the hand of a foe
and the helmet white that his head protected
was destined to dare the deeps of the flood
through wave whirl win  'twas wound with chains
decked with gold as in days of yore
the weapon smith worked it wondrously
with swine forms set it that swords nowise
brandished in battle could bite that helm
nor was that the meanest of mighty helps
which hrothgar's orator offered at need
hrunting they named the hilted sword
of old time heirlooms easily first
iron was its edge all etched with poison
with battle blood hardened nor blenched it at fight
in hero's hand who held it ever
on paths of peril prepared to go
to folkstead {21b} of foes not first time this
it was destined to do a daring task
for he bore not in mind the bairn of ecglaf
sturdy and strong that speech he had made
drunk with wine now this weapon he lent
to a stouter swordsman himself though durst not
under welter of waters wager his life
as loyal liegeman so lost he his glory
honor of earls with the other not so
who girded him now for the grim encounter





beowulf spake bairn of ecgtheow
have mind thou honored offspring of healfdene
gold friend of men now i go on this quest
sovran wise what once was said
if in thy cause it came that i
should lose my life thou wouldst loyal bide
to me though fallen in father's place
be guardian thou to this group of my thanes
my warrior friends if war should seize me
and the goodly gifts thou gavest me
hrothgar beloved to hygelac send
geatland's king may ken by the gold
hrethel's son see when he stares at the treasure
that i got me a friend for goodness famed
and joyed while i could in my jewel bestower
and let unferth wield this wondrous sword
earl far honored this heirloom precious
hard of edge  with hrunting i
seek doom of glory or death shall take me

after these words the weder geat lord
boldly hastened biding never
answer at all  the ocean floods
closed o'er the hero long while of the day
fled ere he felt the floor of the sea

soon found the fiend who the flood domain
sword hungry held these hundred winters
greedy and grim that some guest from above
some man was raiding her monster realm
she grasped out for him with grisly claws
and the warrior seized yet scathed she not
his body hale the breastplate hindered
as she strove to shatter the sark of war
the linked harness with loathsome hand
then bore this brine wolf when bottom she touched
the lord of rings to the lair she haunted
whiles vainly he strove though his valor held
weapon to wield against wondrous monsters
that sore beset him sea beasts many
tried with fierce tusks to tear his mail
and swarmed on the stranger but soon he marked
he was now in some hall he knew not which
where water never could work him harm
nor through the roof could reach him ever
fangs of the flood firelight he saw
beams of a blaze that brightly shone
then the warrior was ware of that wolf of the deep
mere wife monstrous for mighty stroke
he swung his blade and the blow withheld not
then sang on her head that seemly blade
its war song wild but the warrior found
the light of battle {22a} was loath to bite
to harm the heart  its hard edge failed
the noble at need yet had known of old
strife hand to hand and had helmets cloven
doomed men's fighting gear first time this
for the gleaming blade that its glory fell
firm still stood nor failed in valor
heedful of high deeds hygelac's kinsman
flung away fretted sword featly jewelled
the angry earl on earth it lay
steel edged and stiff his strength he trusted
hand gripe of might so man shall do
whenever in war he weens to earn him
lasting fame nor fears for his life
seized then by shoulder shrank not from combat
the geatish war prince grendel's mother
flung then the fierce one filled with wrath
his deadly foe that she fell to ground
swift on her part she paid him back
with grisly grasp and grappled with him
spent with struggle stumbled the warrior
fiercest of fighting men fell adown
on the hall guest she hurled herself hent her short sword
broad and brown edged {22b} the bairn to avenge
the sole born son  on his shoulder lay
braided breast mail barring death
withstanding entrance of edge or blade
life would have ended for ecgtheow's son
under wide earth for that earl of geats
had his armor of war not aided him
battle net hard and holy god
wielded the victory wisest maker
the lord of heaven allowed his cause
and easily rose the earl erect






'mid the battle gear saw he a blade triumphant
old sword of eotens with edge of proof
warriors' heirloom weapon unmatched
 save only 'twas more than other men
to bandy of battle could bear at all
as the giants had wrought it ready and keen
seized then its chain hilt the scyldings' chieftain
bold and battle grim brandished the sword
reckless of life and so wrathfully smote
that it gripped her neck and grasped her hard
her bone rings breaking  the blade pierced through
that fated one's flesh  to floor she sank
bloody the blade  he was blithe of his deed
then blazed forth light 'twas bright within
as when from the sky there shines unclouded
heaven's candle the hall he scanned
by the wall then went he his weapon raised
high by its hilts the hygelac thane
angry and eager that edge was not useless
to the warrior now he wished with speed
grendel to guerdon for grim raids many
for the war he waged on western danes
oftener far than an only time
when of hrothgar's hearth companions
he slew in slumber in sleep devoured
fifteen men of the folk of danes
and as many others outward bore
his horrible prey well paid for that
the wrathful prince for now prone he saw
grendel stretched there spent with war
spoiled of life so scathed had left him
heorot's battle the body sprang far
when after death it endured the blow
sword stroke savage that severed its head
soon {23a} then saw the sage companions
who waited with hrothgar watching the flood
that the tossing waters turbid grew
blood stained the mere old men together
hoary haired of the hero spake
the warrior would not they weened again
proud of conquest come to seek
their mighty master to many it seemed
the wolf of the waves had won his life
the ninth hour came the noble scyldings
left the headland homeward went
the gold friend of men {23b} but the guests sat on
stared at the surges sick in heart
and wished yet weened not their winsome lord
again to see

now that sword began
from blood of the fight in battle droppings {23c}
war blade to wane  'twas a wondrous thing
that all of it melted as ice is wont
when frosty fetters the father loosens
unwinds the wave bonds wielding all
seasons and times  the true god he
nor took from that dwelling the duke of the geats
save only the head and that hilt withal
blazoned with jewels  the blade had melted
burned was the bright sword her blood was so hot
so poisoned the hell sprite who perished within there
soon he was swimming who safe saw in combat
downfall of demons up dove through the flood
the clashing waters were cleansed now
waste of waves where the wandering fiend
her life days left and this lapsing world
swam then to strand the sailors' refuge
sturdy in spirit of sea booty glad
of burden brave he bore with him
went then to greet him and god they thanked
the thane band choice of their chieftain blithe
that safe and sound they could see him again
soon from the hardy one helmet and armor
deftly they doffed  now drowsed the mere
water 'neath welkin with war blood stained
forth they fared by the footpaths thence
merry at heart the highways measured
well known roads courageous men
carried the head from the cliff by the sea
an arduous task for all the band
the firm in fight since four were needed
on the shaft of slaughter {23d} strenuously
to bear to the gold hall grendel's head
so presently to the palace there
foemen fearless fourteen geats
marching came their master of clan
mighty amid them the meadow ways trod
strode then within the sovran thane
fearless in fight of fame renowned
hardy hero hrothgar to greet
and next by the hair into hall was borne
grendel's head where the henchmen were drinking
an awe to clan and queen alike
a monster of marvel  the men looked on





beowulf spake bairn of ecgtheow
lo now this sea booty son of healfdene
lord of scyldings we've lustily brought thee
sign of glory thou seest it here
not lightly did i with my life escape
in war under water this work i essayed
with endless effort and even so
my strength had been lost had the lord not shielded me
not a whit could i with hrunting do
in work of war though the weapon is good
yet a sword the sovran of men vouchsafed me
to spy on the wall there in splendor hanging
old gigantic  how oft he guides
the friendless wight  and i fought with that brand
felling in fight since fate was with me
the house's wardens that war sword then
all burned bright blade when the blood gushed o'er it
battle sweat hot but the hilt i brought back
from my foes so avenged i their fiendish deeds
death fall of danes as was due and right
and this is my hest that in heorot now
safe thou canst sleep with thy soldier band
and every thane of all thy folk
both old and young no evil fear
scyldings' lord from that side again
aught ill for thy earls as erst thou must
then the golden hilt for that gray haired leader
hoary hero in hand was laid
giant wrought old so owned and enjoyed it
after downfall of devils the danish lord
wonder smiths' work since the world was rid
of that grim souled fiend the foe of god
murder marked and his mother as well
now it passed into power of the people's king
best of all that the oceans bound
who have scattered their gold o'er scandia's isle
hrothgar spake  the hilt he viewed
heirloom old where was etched the rise
of that far off fight when the floods o'erwhelmed
raging waves the race of giants
(fearful their fate) a folk estranged
from god eternal  whence guerdon due
in that waste of waters the wielder paid them
so on the guard of shining gold
in runic staves it was rightly said
for whom the serpent traced sword was wrought
best of blades in bygone days
and the hilt well wound  the wise one spake
son of healfdene silent were all
lo so may he say who sooth and right
follows 'mid folk of far times mindful
a land warden old {24a} that this earl belongs
to the better breed so borne aloft
thy fame must fly o friend my beowulf
far and wide o'er folksteads many firmly thou
shalt all maintain
mighty strength with mood of wisdom love of
mine will i assure thee
as awhile ago i promised thou shalt prove a stay
in future
in far off years to folk of thine
to the heroes a help was not heremod thus
to offspring of ecgwela honor scyldings
nor grew for their grace but for grisly slaughter
for doom of death to the danishmen

he slew wrath swollen his shoulder comrades
companions at board so he passed alone
chieftain haughty from human cheer
though him the maker with might endowed
delights of power and uplifted high
above all men yet blood fierce his mind
his breast hoard grew no bracelets gave he
to danes as was due he endured all joyless
strain of struggle and stress of woe
long feud with his folk here find thy lesson
of virtue advise thee this verse i have said for thee
wise from lapsed winters wondrous seems
how to sons of men almighty god
in the strength of his spirit sendeth wisdom
estate high station  he swayeth all things
whiles he letteth right lustily fare
the heart of the hero of high born race
in seat ancestral assigns him bliss
his folk's sure fortress in fee to hold
puts in his power great parts of the earth
empire so ample that end of it
this wanter of wisdom weeneth none
so he waxes in wealth nowise can harm him
illness or age no evil cares
shadow his spirit no sword hate threatens
from ever an enemy  all the world
wends at his will no worse he knoweth
till all within him obstinate pride
waxes and wakes while the warden slumbers
the spirit's sentry sleep is too fast
which masters his might and the murderer nears
stealthily shooting the shafts from his bow





under harness his heart then is hit indeed
by sharpest shafts and no shelter avails
from foul behest of the hellish fiend {25a}
him seems too little what long he possessed
greedy and grim no golden rings
he gives for his pride the promised future
forgets he and spurns with all god has sent him
wonder wielder of wealth and fame
yet in the end it ever comes
that the frame of the body fragile yields
fated falls and there follows another
who joyously the jewels divides
the royal riches nor recks of his forebear
ban then such baleful thoughts beowulf dearest
best of men and the better part choose
profit eternal and temper thy pride
warrior famous the flower of thy might
lasts now a while  but erelong it shall be
that sickness or sword thy strength shall minish
or fang of fire or flooding billow
or bite of blade or brandished spear
or odious age or the eyes' clear beam
wax dull and darken  death even thee
in haste shall o'erwhelm thou hero of war
so the ring danes these half years a hundred i ruled
wielded 'neath welkin and warded them bravely
from mighty ones many o'er middle earth
from spear and sword till it seemed for me
no foe could be found under fold of the sky
lo sudden the shift to me seated secure
came grief for joy when grendel began
to harry my home the hellish foe
for those ruthless raids unresting i suffered
heart sorrow heavy heaven be thanked
lord eternal for life extended
that i on this head all hewn and bloody
after long evil with eyes may gaze
 go to the bench now be glad at banquet
warrior worthy a wealth of treasure
at dawn of day be dealt between us
glad was the geats' lord going betimes
to seek his seat as the sage commanded
afresh as before for the famed in battle
for the band of the hall was a banquet dight
nobly anew the night helm darkened
dusk o'er the drinkers
the doughty ones rose
for the hoary headed would hasten to rest
aged scylding and eager the geat
shield fighter sturdy for sleeping yearned
him wander weary warrior guest
from far a hall thane heralded forth
who by custom courtly cared for all
needs of a thane as in those old days
warrior wanderers wont to have
so slumbered the stout heart stately the hall
rose gabled and gilt where the guest slept on
till a raven black the rapture of heaven {25b}
blithe heart boded bright came flying
shine after shadow the swordsmen hastened
athelings all were eager homeward
forth to fare and far from thence
the great hearted guest would guide his keel
bade then the hardy one hrunting be brought
to the son of ecglaf the sword bade him take
excellent iron and uttered his thanks for it
quoth that he counted it keen in battle
war friend winsome  with words he slandered not
edge of the blade  'twas a big hearted man
now eager for parting and armed at point
warriors waited while went to his host
that darling of danes the doughty atheling
to high seat hastened and hrothgar greeted





beowulf spake bairn of ecgtheow
lo we seafarers say our will
far come men that we fain would seek
hygelac now we here have found
hosts to our heart  thou hast harbored us well
if ever on earth i am able to win me
more of thy love o lord of men
aught anew than i now have done
for work of war i am willing still
if it come to me ever across the seas
that neighbor foemen annoy and fright thee
as they that hate thee erewhile have used
thousands then of thanes i shall bring
heroes to help thee of hygelac i know
ward of his folk that though few his years
the lord of the geats will give me aid
by word and by work that well i may serve thee
wielding the war wood to win thy triumph
and lending thee might when thou lackest men
if thy hrethric should come to court of geats
a sovran's son he will surely there
find his friends a far off land
each man should visit who vaunts him brave
him then answering hrothgar spake
these words of thine the wisest god
sent to thy soul no sager counsel
from so young in years e'er yet have i heard
thou art strong of main and in mind art wary
art wise in words i ween indeed
if ever it hap that hrethel's heir
by spear be seized by sword grim battle
by illness or iron thine elder and lord
people's leader  and life be thine
no seemlier man will the sea geats find
at all to choose for their chief and king
for hoard guard of heroes if hold thou wilt
thy kinsman's kingdom thy keen mind pleases me
the longer the better beowulf loved

thou hast brought it about that both our peoples
sons of the geat and spear dane folk
shall have mutual peace and from murderous strife
such as once they waged from war refrain
long as i rule this realm so wide
let our hoards be common let heroes with gold
each other greet o'er the gannet's bath
and the ringed prow bear o'er rolling waves
tokens of love i trow my landfolk
towards friend and foe are firmly joined
and honor they keep in the olden way
to him in the hall then healfdene's son
gave treasures twelve and the trust of earls
bade him fare with the gifts to his folk beloved
hale to his home and in haste return
then kissed the king of kin renowned
scyldings' chieftain that choicest thane
and fell on his neck fast flowed the tears
of the hoary headed heavy with winters
he had chances twain but he clung to this {26a}
that each should look on the other again
and hear him in hall was this hero so dear to him
his breast's wild billows he banned in vain
safe in his soul a secret longing
locked in his mind for that loved man
burned in his blood then beowulf strode
glad of his gold gifts the grass plot o'er
warrior blithe the wave roamer bode
riding at anchor its owner awaiting
as they hastened onward hrothgar's gift
they lauded at length  'twas a lord unpeered
every way blameless till age had broken
 it spareth no mortal  his splendid might





came now to ocean the ever courageous
hardy henchmen their harness bearing
woven war sarks the warden marked
trusty as ever the earl's return
from the height of the hill no hostile words
reached the guests as he rode to greet them
but welcome he called to that weder clan
as the sheen mailed spoilers to ship marched on
then on the strand with steeds and treasure
and armor their roomy and ring dight ship
was heavily laden  high its mast
rose over hrothgar's hoarded gems
a sword to the boat guard beowulf gave
mounted with gold on the mead bench since
he was better esteemed that blade possessing
heirloom old  their ocean keel boarding
they drove through the deep and daneland left
a sea cloth was set a sail with ropes
firm to the mast the flood timbers moaned {27a}
nor did wind over billows that wave swimmer blow
across from her course the craft sped on
foam necked it floated forth o'er the waves
keel firm bound over briny currents
till they got them sight of the geatish cliffs
home known headlands high the boat
stirred by winds on the strand updrove
helpful at haven the harbor guard stood
who long already for loved companions
by the water had waited and watched afar
he bound to the beach the broad bosomed ship
with anchor bands lest ocean billows
that trusty timber should tear away
then beowulf bade them bear the treasure
gold and jewels no journey far
was it thence to go to the giver of rings
hygelac hrethling  at home he dwelt
by the sea wall close himself and clan
haughty that house a hero the king
high the hall and hygd {27b} right young
wise and wary though winters few
in those fortress walls she had found a home
haereth's daughter nor humble her ways
nor grudged she gifts to the geatish men
of precious treasure not thryth's pride showed she
folk queen famed or that fell deceit
was none so daring that durst make bold
(save her lord alone) of the liegemen dear
that lady full in the face to look
but forged fetters he found his lot
bonds of death and brief the respite
soon as they seized him his sword doom was spoken
and the burnished blade a baleful murder
proclaimed and closed no queenly way
for woman to practise though peerless she
that the weaver of peace {27c} from warrior dear
by wrath and lying his life should reave
but hemming's kinsman hindered this
for over their ale men also told
that of these folk horrors fewer she wrought
onslaughts of evil after she went
gold decked bride to the brave young prince
atheling haughty and offa's hall
o'er the fallow flood at her father's bidding
safely sought where since she prospered
royal throned rich in goods
fain of the fair life fate had sent her
and leal in love to the lord of warriors
he of all heroes i heard of ever
from sea to sea of the sons of earth
most excellent seemed hence offa was praised
for his fighting and feeing by far off men
the spear bold warrior wisely he ruled
over his empire eomer woke to him
help of heroes hemming's kinsman
grandson of garmund grim in war





hastened the hardy one henchmen with him
sandy strand of the sea to tread
and widespread ways the world's great candle
sun shone from south they strode along
with sturdy steps to the spot they knew
where the battle king young his burg within
slayer of ongentheow shared the rings
shelter of heroes to hygelac
beowulf's coming was quickly told
that there in the court the clansmen's refuge
the shield companion sound and alive
hale from the hero play homeward strode
with haste in the hall by highest order
room for the rovers was readily made
by his sovran he sat come safe from battle
kinsman by kinsman his kindly lord
he first had greeted in gracious form
with manly words the mead dispensing
came through the high hall haereth's daughter
winsome to warriors wine cup bore
to the hands of the heroes hygelac then
his comrade fairly with question plied
in the lofty hall sore longing to know
what manner of sojourn the sea geats made
what came of thy quest my kinsman beowulf
when thy yearnings suddenly swept thee yonder
battle to seek o'er the briny sea
combat in heorot? hrothgar couldst thou
aid at all the honored chief
in his wide known woes? with waves of care
my sad heart seethed i sore mistrusted
my loved one's venture  long i begged thee
by no means to seek that slaughtering monster
but suffer the south danes to settle their feud
themselves with grendel now god be thanked
that safe and sound i can see thee now
beowulf spake the bairn of ecgtheow
'tis known and unhidden hygelac lord
to many men that meeting of ours
struggle grim between grendel and me
which we fought on the field where full too many
sorrows he wrought for the scylding victors
evils unending these all i avenged
no boast can be from breed of grendel
any on earth for that uproar at dawn
from the longest lived of the loathsome race
in fleshly fold  but first i went
hrothgar to greet in the hall of gifts
where healfdene's kinsman high renowned
soon as my purpose was plain to him
assigned me a seat by his son and heir
the liegemen were lusty my life days never
such merry men over mead in hall
have i heard under heaven the high born queen
people's peace bringer passed through the hall
cheered the young clansmen clasps of gold
ere she sought her seat to sundry gave
oft to the heroes hrothgar's daughter
to earls in turn the ale cup tendered
she whom i heard these hall companions
freawaru name when fretted gold
she proffered the warriors promised is she
gold decked maid to the glad son of froda
sage this seems to the scylding's friend
kingdom's keeper  he counts it wise
the woman to wed so and ward off feud
store of slaughter but seldom ever
when men are slain does the murder spear sink
but briefest while though the bride be fair {28a}
nor haply will like it the heathobard lord
and as little each of his liegemen all
when a thane of the danes in that doughty throng
goes with the lady along their hall
and on him the old time heirlooms glisten
hard and ring decked heathobard's treasure
weapons that once they wielded fair
until they lost at the linden play {28b}
liegeman leal and their lives as well
then over the ale on this heirloom gazing
some ash wielder old who has all in mind
that spear death of men {28c}  he is stern of mood
heavy at heart  in the hero young
tests the temper and tries the soul
and war hate wakens with words like these
canst thou not comrade ken that sword
which to the fray thy father carried
in his final feud 'neath the fighting mask
dearest of blades when the danish slew him
and wielded the war place on withergild's fall
after havoc of heroes those hardy scyldings?
now the son of a certain slaughtering dane
proud of his treasure paces this hall
joys in the killing and carries the jewel {28d}
that rightfully ought to be owned by thee_
thus he urges and eggs him all the time
with keenest words till occasion offers
that freawaru's thane for his father's deed
after bite of brand in his blood must slumber
losing his life but that liegeman flies
living away for the land he kens
and thus be broken on both their sides
oaths of the earls when ingeld's breast
wells with war hate and wife love now
after the care billows cooler grows
so {28e} i hold not high the heathobards' faith
due to the danes or their during love
and pact of peace  but i pass from that
turning to grendel o giver of treasure
and saying in full how the fight resulted
hand fray of heroes when heaven's jewel
had fled o'er far fields that fierce sprite came
night foe savage to seek us out
where safe and sound we sentried the hall
to hondscio then was that harassing deadly
his fall there was fated he first was slain
girded warrior grendel on him
turned murderous mouth on our mighty kinsman
and all of the brave man's body devoured
yet none the earlier empty handed
would the bloody toothed murderer mindful of bale
outward go from the gold decked hall
but me he attacked in his terror of might
with greedy hand grasped me a glove hung by him {28f}
wide and wondrous wound with bands
and in artful wise it all was wrought
by devilish craft of dragon skins
me therein an innocent man
the fiendish foe was fain to thrust
with many another he might not so
when i all angrily upright stood
'twere long to relate how that land destroyer
i paid in kind for his cruel deeds
yet there my prince this people of thine
got fame by my fighting he fled away
and a little space his life preserved
but there staid behind him his stronger hand
left in heorot heartsick thence
on the floor of the ocean that outcast fell
me for this struggle the scyldings' friend
paid in plenty with plates of gold
with many a treasure when morn had come
and we all at the banquet board sat down
then was song and glee the gray haired scylding
much tested told of the times of yore
whiles the hero his harp bestirred
wood of delight now lays he chanted
of sooth and sadness or said aright
legends of wonder the wide hearted king
or for years of his youth he would yearn at times
for strength of old struggles now stricken with age
hoary hero  his heart surged full
when wise with winters he wailed their flight
thus in the hall the whole of that day
at ease we feasted till fell o'er earth
another night anon full ready
in greed of vengeance grendel's mother
set forth all doleful dead was her son
through war hate of weders now woman monstrous
with fury fell a foeman she slew
avenged her offspring from aeschere old
loyal councillor life was gone
nor might they e'en when morning broke
those danish people their death done comrade
burn with brands on balefire lay
the man they mourned under mountain stream
she had carried the corpse with cruel hands
for hrothgar that was the heaviest sorrow
of all that had laden the lord of his folk
the leader then by thy life besought me
(sad was his soul) in the sea waves' coil
to play the hero and hazard my being
for glory of prowess  my guerdon he pledged
i then in the waters  'tis widely known
that sea floor guardian savage found
hand to hand there a while we struggled
billows welled blood in the briny hall
her head i hewed with a hardy blade
from grendel's mother  and gained my life
though not without danger my doom was not yet
then the haven of heroes healfdene's son
gave me in guerdon great gifts of price





so held this king to the customs old
that i wanted for nought in the wage i gained
the meed of my might he made me gifts
healfdene's heir for my own disposal
now to thee my prince i proffer them all
gladly give them thy grace alone
can find me favor few indeed
have i of kinsmen save hygelac thee
then he bade them bear him the boar head standard
the battle helm high and breastplate gray
the splendid sword then spake in form
me this war gear the wise old prince
hrothgar gave and his hest he added
that its story be straightway said to thee
a while it was held by heorogar king
for long time lord of the land of scyldings
yet not to his son the sovran left it
to daring heoroweard  dear as he was to him
his harness of battle  well hold thou it all
and i heard that soon passed o'er the path of this treasure
all apple fallow four good steeds
each like the others arms and horses
he gave to the king so should kinsmen be
not weave one another the net of wiles
or with deep hid treachery death contrive
for neighbor and comrade his nephew was ever
by hardy hygelac held full dear
and each kept watch o'er the other's weal
i heard too the necklace to hygd he presented
wonder wrought treasure which wealhtheow gave him
sovran's daughter  three steeds he added
slender and saddle gay since such gift
the gem gleamed bright on the breast of the queen
thus showed his strain the son of ecgtheow
as a man remarked for mighty deeds
and acts of honor at ale he slew not
comrade or kin nor cruel his mood
though of sons of earth his strength was greatest
a glorious gift that god had sent
the splendid leader long was he spurned
and worthless by geatish warriors held
him at mead the master of clans
failed full oft to favor at all
slack and shiftless the strong men deemed him
profitless prince but payment came
to the warrior honored for all his woes
then the bulwark of earls {29a} bade bring within
hardy chieftain hrethel's heirloom
garnished with gold  no geat e'er knew
in shape of a sword a statelier prize
the brand he laid in beowulf's lap
and of hides assigned him seven thousand {29b}
with house and high seat they held in common
land alike by their line of birth
inheritance home  but higher the king
because of his rule o'er the realm itself

now further it fell with the flight of years
with harryings horrid that hygelac perished {29c}
and heardred too by hewing of swords
under the shield wall slaughtered lay
when him at the van of his victor folk
sought hardy heroes heatho scilfings
in arms o'erwhelming hereric's nephew
then beowulf came as king this broad
realm to wield and he ruled it well
fifty winters {29d} a wise old prince
warding his land until one began
in the dark of night a dragon to rage
in the grave on the hill a hoard it guarded
in the stone barrow steep a strait path reached it
unknown to mortals some man however
came by chance that cave within
to the heathen hoard {29e} in hand he took
a golden goblet nor gave he it back
stole with it away while the watcher slept
by thievish wiles  for the warden's wrath
prince and people must pay betimes





that way he went with no will of his own
in danger of life to the dragon's hoard
but for pressure of peril some prince's thane
he fled in fear the fatal scourge
seeking shelter a sinful man
and entered in at the awful sight
tottered that guest and terror seized him
yet the wretched fugitive rallied anon
from fright and fear ere he fled away
and took the cup from that treasure hoard
of such besides there was store enough
heirlooms old the earth below
which some earl forgotten in ancient years
left the last of his lofty race
heedfully there had hidden away
dearest treasure for death of yore
had hurried all hence and he alone
left to live the last of the clan
weeping his friends yet wished to bide
warding the treasure his one delight
though brief his respite the barrow new ready
to strand and sea waves stood anear
hard by the headland hidden and closed
there laid within it his lordly heirlooms
and heaped hoard of heavy gold
that warden of rings few words he spake
now hold thou earth since heroes may not
what earls have owned lo erst from thee
brave men brought it but battle death seized
and cruel killing my clansmen all
robbed them of life and a liegeman's joys
none have i left to lift the sword
or to cleanse the carven cup of price
beaker bright my brave are gone
and the helmet hard all haughty with gold
shall part from its plating polishers sleep
who could brighten and burnish the battle mask
and those weeds of war that were wont to brave
over bicker of shields the bite of steel
rust with their bearer the ringed mail
fares not far with famous chieftain
at side of hero no harp's delight
no glee wood's gladness no good hawk now
flies through the hall nor horses fleet
stamp in the burgstead battle and death
the flower of my race have reft away
mournful of mood thus he moaned his woe
alone for them all and unblithe wept
by day and by night till death's fell wave
o'erwhelmed his heart his hoard of bliss
that old ill doer open found
who blazing at twilight the barrows haunteth
naked foe dragon flying by night
folded in fire  the folk of earth
dread him sore 'tis his doom to seek
hoard in the graves and heathen gold
to watch many wintered  nor wins he thereby
powerful this plague of the people thus
held the house of the hoard in earth
three hundred winters till one aroused
wrath in his breast to the ruler bearing
that costly cup and the king implored
for bond of peace so the barrow was plundered
borne off was booty his boon was granted
that wretched man and his ruler saw
first time what was fashioned in far off days
when the dragon awoke new woe was kindled
o'er the stone he snuffed the stark heart found
footprint of foe who so far had gone
in his hidden craft by the creature's head
so may the undoomed easily flee
evils and exile if only he gain
the grace of the wielder  that warden of gold
o'er the ground went seeking greedy to find
the man who wrought him such wrong in sleep
savage and burning the barrow he circled
all without nor was any there
none in the waste yet war he desired
was eager for battle the barrow he entered
sought the cup and discovered soon
that some one of mortals had searched his treasure
his lordly gold the guardian waited
ill enduring till evening came
boiling with wrath was the barrow's keeper
and fain with flame the foe to pay
for the dear cup's loss  now day was fled
as the worm had wished by its wall no more
was it glad to bide but burning flew
folded in flame  a fearful beginning
for sons of the soil and soon it came
in the doom of their lord to a dreadful end





then the baleful fiend its fire belched out
and bright homes burned the blaze stood high
all landsfolk frighting no living thing
would that loathly one leave as aloft it flew
wide was the dragon's warring seen
its fiendish fury far and near
as the grim destroyer those geatish people
hated and hounded to hidden lair
to its hoard it hastened at hint of dawn
folk of the land it had lapped in flame
with bale and brand in its barrow it trusted
its battling and bulwarks  that boast was vain

to beowulf then the bale was told
quickly and truly  the king's own home
of buildings the best in brand waves melted
that gift throne of geats to the good old man
sad in heart 'twas heaviest sorrow
the sage assumed that his sovran god
he had angered breaking ancient law
and embittered the lord his breast within
with black thoughts welled as his wont was never
the folk's own fastness that fiery dragon
with flame had destroyed and the stronghold all
washed by waves but the warlike king
prince of the weders plotted vengeance
warriors' bulwark he bade them work
all of iron  the earl's commander
a war shield wondrous  well he knew
that forest wood against fire were worthless
linden could aid not  atheling brave
he was fated to finish this fleeting life {31a}
his days on earth and the dragon with him
though long it had watched o'er the wealth of the hoard
shame he reckoned it sharer of rings
to follow the flyer afar with a host
a broad flung band nor the battle feared he
nor deemed he dreadful the dragon's warring
its vigor and valor  ventures desperate
he had passed a plenty and perils of war
contest crash since conqueror proud
hrothgar's hall he had wholly purged
and in grapple had killed the kin of grendel
loathsome breed not least was that
of hand to hand fights where hygelac fell
when the ruler of geats in rush of battle
lord of his folk in the frisian land
son of hrethel by sword draughts died
by brands down beaten thence beowulf fled
through strength of himself and his swimming power
though alone and his arms were laden with thirty
coats of mail when he came to the sea
nor yet might hetwaras {31b} haughtily boast
their craft of contest who carried against him
shields to the fight  but few escaped
from strife with the hero to seek their homes
then swam over ocean ecgtheow's son
lonely and sorrowful seeking his land
where hygd made him offer of hoard and realm
rings and royal seat reckoning naught
the strength of her son to save their kingdom
from hostile hordes after hygelac's death
no sooner for this could the stricken ones
in any wise move that atheling's mind
over young heardred's head as lord
and ruler of all the realm to be
yet the hero upheld him with helpful words
aided in honor till older grown
he wielded the weder geats  wandering exiles
sought him o'er seas the sons of ohtere
who had spurned the sway of the scylfings' helmet
the bravest and best that broke the rings
in swedish land of the sea kings' line
haughty hero {31c} hence heardred's end
for shelter he gave them sword death came
the blade's fell blow to bairn of hygelac
but the son of ongentheow sought again
house and home when heardred fell
leaving beowulf lord of geats
and gift seat's master  a good king he





the fall of his lord he was fain to requite
in after days and to eadgils he proved
friend to the friendless and forces sent
over the sea to the son of ohtere
weapons and warriors  well repaid he
those care paths cold when the king he slew {32a}
thus safe through struggles the son of ecgtheow
had passed a plenty through perils dire
with daring deeds till this day was come
that doomed him now with the dragon to strive
with comrades eleven the lord of geats
swollen in rage went seeking the dragon
he had heard whence all the harm arose
and the killing of clansmen that cup of price
on the lap of the lord had been laid by the finder
in the throng was this one thirteenth man
starter of all the strife and ill
care laden captive cringing thence
forced and reluctant he led them on
till he came in ken of that cavern hall
the barrow delved near billowy surges
flood of ocean within 'twas full
of wire gold and jewels a jealous warden
warrior trusty the treasures held
lurked in his lair not light the task
of entrance for any of earth born men
sat on the headland the hero king
spake words of hail to his hearth companions
gold friend of geats all gloomy his soul
wavering death bound wyrd full nigh
stood ready to greet the gray haired man
to seize his soul hoard sunder apart
life and body not long would be
the warrior's spirit enwound with flesh
beowulf spake the bairn of ecgtheow
through store of struggles i strove in youth
mighty feuds i mind them all
i was seven years old when the sovran of rings
friend of his folk from my father took me
had me and held me hrethel the king
with food and fee faithful in kinship
ne'er while i lived there he loathlier found me
bairn in the burg than his birthright sons
herebeald and haethcyn and hygelac mine
for the eldest of these by unmeet chance
by kinsman's deed was the death bed strewn
when haethcyn killed him with horny bow
his own dear liege laid low with an arrow
missed the mark and his mate shot down
one brother the other with bloody shaft
a feeless fight {32b} and a fearful sin
horror to hrethel yet hard as it was
unavenged must the atheling die
too awful it is for an aged man
to bide and bear that his bairn so young
rides on the gallows a rime he makes
sorrow song for his son there hanging
as rapture of ravens no rescue now
can come from the old disabled man
still is he minded as morning breaks
of the heir gone elsewhere {32c} another he hopes not
he will bide to see his burg within
as ward for his wealth now the one has found
doom of death that the deed incurred
forlorn he looks on the lodge of his son
wine hall waste and wind swept chambers
reft of revel the rider sleepeth
the hero far hidden {32d} no harp resounds
in the courts no wassail as once was heard





then he goes to his chamber a grief song chants
alone for his lost too large all seems
homestead and house so the helmet of weders
hid in his heart for herebeald
waves of woe no way could he take
to avenge on the slayer slaughter so foul
nor e'en could he harass that hero at all
with loathing deed though he loved him not
and so for the sorrow his soul endured
men's gladness he gave up and god's light chose
lands and cities he left his sons
(as the wealthy do) when he went from earth
there was strife and struggle 'twixt swede and geat
o'er the width of waters war arose
hard battle horror when hrethel died
and ongentheow's offspring grew
strife keen bold nor brooked o'er the seas
pact of peace but pushed their hosts
to harass in hatred by hreosnabeorh
men of my folk for that feud had vengeance
for woful war ('tis widely known)
though one of them bought it with blood of his heart
a bargain hard  for haethcyn proved
fatal that fray for the first of geats
at morn i heard was the murderer killed
by kinsman for kinsman {33a} with clash of sword
when ongentheow met eofor there
wide split the war helm  wan he fell
hoary scylfing the hand that smote him
of feud was mindful nor flinched from the death blow
 for all that he {33b} gave me my gleaming sword
repaid him at war  such power i wielded
for lordly treasure  with land he entrusted me
homestead and house he had no need
from swedish realm or from spear dane folk
or from men of the gifths to get him help
some warrior worse for wage to buy
ever i fought in the front of all
sole to the fore and so shall i fight
while i bide in life and this blade shall last
that early and late hath loyal proved
since for my doughtiness daeghrefn fell
slain by my hand the hugas' champion
nor fared he thence to the frisian king
with the booty back and breast adornments
but slain in struggle that standard bearer
fell atheling brave not with blade was he slain
but his bones were broken by brawny gripe
his heart waves stilled  the sword edge now
hard blade and my hand for the hoard shall strive
beowulf spake and a battle vow made
his last of all  i have lived through many
wars in my youth now once again
old folk defender feud will i seek
do doughty deeds if the dark destroyer
forth from his cavern come to fight me
then hailed he the helmeted heroes all
for the last time greeting his liegemen dear
comrades of war  i should carry no weapon
no sword to the serpent if sure i knew
how with such enemy else my vows
i could gain as i did in grendel's day
but fire in this fight i must fear me now
and poisonous breath so i bring with me
breastplate and board {33c} from the barrow's keeper
no footbreadth flee i one fight shall end
our war by the wall as wyrd allots
all mankind's master my mood is bold
but forbears to boast o'er this battling flyer
 now abide by the barrow ye breastplate mailed
ye heroes in harness which of us twain
better from battle rush bear his wounds
wait ye the finish the fight is not yours
nor meet for any but me alone
to measure might with this monster here
and play the hero hardily i
shall win that wealth or war shall seize
cruel killing your king and lord
up stood then with shield the sturdy champion
stayed by the strength of his single manhood
and hardy 'neath helmet his harness bore
under cleft of the cliffs  no coward's path
soon spied by the wall that warrior chief
survivor of many a victory field
where foemen fought with furious clashings
an arch of stone and within a stream
that broke from the barrow the brooklet's wave
was hot with fire the hoard that way
he never could hope unharmed to near
or endure those deeps {33d} for the dragon's flame
then let from his breast for he burst with rage
the weder geat prince a word outgo
stormed the stark heart stern went ringing
and clear his cry 'neath the cliff rocks gray
the hoard guard heard a human voice
his rage was enkindled no respite now
for pact of peace the poison breath
of that foul worm first came forth from the cave
hot reek of fight  the rocks resounded
stout by the stone way his shield he raised
lord of the geats against the loathed one
while with courage keen that coiled foe
came seeking strife the sturdy king
had drawn his sword not dull of edge
heirloom old and each of the two
felt fear of his foe though fierce their mood
stoutly stood with his shield high raised
the warrior king as the worm now coiled
together amain  the mailed one waited
now spire by spire fast sped and glided
that blazing serpent the shield protected
soul and body a shorter while
for the hero king than his heart desired
could his will have wielded the welcome respite
but once in his life but wyrd denied it
and victory's honors  his arm he lifted
lord of the geats the grim foe smote
with atheling's heirloom its edge was turned
brown blade on the bone and bit more feebly
than its noble master had need of then
in his baleful stress  then the barrow's keeper
waxed full wild for that weighty blow
cast deadly flames wide drove and far
those vicious fires no victor's glory
the geats' lord boasted his brand had failed
naked in battle as never it should
excellent iron  'twas no easy path
that ecgtheow's honored heir must tread
over the plain to the place of the foe
for against his will he must win a home
elsewhere far as must all men leaving
this lapsing life  not long it was
ere those champions grimly closed again
the hoard guard was heartened high heaved his breast
once more and by peril was pressed again
enfolded in flames the folk commander
nor yet about him his band of comrades
sons of athelings armed stood
with warlike front  to the woods they bent them
their lives to save but the soul of one
with care was cumbered kinship true
can never be marred in a noble mind





wiglaf his name was weohstan's son
linden thane loved the lord of scylfings
aelfhere's kinsman his king he now saw
with heat under helmet hard oppressed
he minded the prizes his prince had given him
wealthy seat of the waegmunding line
and folk rights that his father owned
not long he lingered the linden yellow
his shield he seized the old sword he drew
as heirloom of eanmund earth dwellers knew it
who was slain by the sword edge son of ohtere
friendless exile erst in fray
killed by weohstan who won for his kin
brown bright helmet breastplate ringed
old sword of eotens onela's gift
weeds of war of the warrior thane
battle gear brave  though a brother's child
had been felled the feud was unfelt by onela {34a}
for winters this war gear weohstan kept
breastplate and board till his bairn had grown
earlship to earn as the old sire did
then he gave him mid geats the gear of battle
portion huge when he passed from life
fared aged forth for the first time now
with his leader lord the liegeman young
was bidden to share the shock of battle
neither softened his soul nor the sire's bequest
weakened in war {34b} so the worm found out
when once in fight the foes had met
wiglaf spake  and his words were sage
sad in spirit he said to his comrades
i remember the time when mead we took
what promise we made to this prince of ours
in the banquet hall to our breaker of rings
for gear of combat to give him requital
for hard sword and helmet if hap should bring
stress of this sort himself who chose us
from all his army to aid him now
urged us to glory and gave these treasures
because he counted us keen with the spear
and hardy 'neath helm though this hero work
our leader hoped unhelped and alone
to finish for us  folk defender
who hath got him glory greater than all men
for daring deeds now the day is come
that our noble master has need of the might
of warriors stout let us stride along
the hero to help while the heat is about him
glowing and grim for god is my witness
i am far more fain the fire should seize
along with my lord these limbs of mine {34c}
unsuiting it seems our shields to bear
homeward hence save here we essay
to fell the foe and defend the life
of the weders' lord i wot 'twere shame
on the law of our land if alone the king
out of geatish warriors woe endured
and sank in the struggle my sword and helmet
breastplate and board for us both shall serve
through slaughter reek strode he to succor his chieftain
his battle helm bore and brief words spake
beowulf dearest do all bravely
as in youthful days of yore thou vowedst
that while life should last thou wouldst let no wise
thy glory droop now great in deeds
atheling steadfast with all thy strength
shield thy life i will stand to help thee
at the words the worm came once again
murderous monster mad with rage
with fire billows flaming its foes to seek
the hated men in heat waves burned
that board {34d} to the boss and the breastplate failed
to shelter at all the spear thane young
yet quickly under his kinsman's shield
went eager the earl since his own was now
all burned by the blaze the bold king again
had mind of his glory  with might his glaive
was driven into the dragon's head
blow nerved by hate but naegling {34e} was shivered
broken in battle was beowulf's sword
old and gray 'twas granted him not
that ever the edge of iron at all
could help him at strife  too strong was his hand
so the tale is told and he tried too far
with strength of stroke all swords he wielded
though sturdy their steel  they steaded him nought
then for the third time thought on its feud
that folk destroyer fire dread dragon
and rushed on the hero where room allowed
battle grim burning its bitter teeth
closed on his neck and covered him
with waves of blood from his breast that welled





'twas now men say in his sovran's need
that the earl made known his noble strain
craft and keenness and courage enduring
heedless of harm though his hand was burned
hardy hearted he helped his kinsman
a little lower the loathsome beast
he smote with sword his steel drove in
bright and burnished that blaze began
to lose and lessen at last the king
wielded his wits again war knife drew
a biting blade by his breastplate hanging
and the weders' helm smote that worm asunder
felled the foe flung forth its life
so had they killed it kinsmen both
athelings twain  thus an earl should be
in danger's day  of deeds of valor
this conqueror's hour of the king was last
of his work in the world the wound began
which that dragon of earth had erst inflicted
to swell and smart and soon he found
in his breast was boiling baleful and deep
pain of poison the prince walked on
wise in his thought to the wall of rock
then sat and stared at the structure of giants
where arch of stone and steadfast column
upheld forever that hall in earth
yet here must the hand of the henchman peerless
lave with water his winsome lord
the king and conqueror covered with blood
with struggle spent and unspan his helmet
beowulf spake in spite of his hurt
his mortal wound full well he knew
his portion now was past and gone
of earthly bliss and all had fled
of his file of days and death was near
i would fain bestow on son of mine
this gear of war were given me now
that any heir should after me come
of my proper blood this people i ruled
fifty winters no folk king was there
none at all of the neighboring clans
who war would wage me with 'warriors' friends' {35a}
and threat me with horrors at home i bided
what fate might come and i cared for mine own
feuds i sought not nor falsely swore
ever on oath for all these things
though fatally wounded fain am i
from the ruler of man no wrath shall seize me
when life from my frame must flee away
for killing of kinsmen now quickly go
and gaze on that hoard 'neath the hoary rock
wiglaf loved now the worm lies low
sleeps heart sore of his spoil bereaved
and fare in haste i would fain behold
the gorgeous heirlooms golden store
have joy in the jewels and gems lay down
softlier for sight of this splendid hoard
my life and the lordship i long have held





i have heard that swiftly the son of weohstan
at wish and word of his wounded king
war sick warrior  woven mail coat
battle sark bore 'neath the barrow's roof
then the clansman keen of conquest proud
passing the seat {36a} saw store of jewels
and glistening gold the ground along
by the wall were marvels and many a vessel
in the den of the dragon the dawn flier old
unburnished bowls of bygone men
reft of richness rusty helms
of the olden age and arm rings many
wondrously woven  such wealth of gold
booty from barrow can burden with pride
each human wight  let him hide it who will
his glance too fell on a gold wove banner
high o'er the hoard of handiwork noblest
brilliantly broidered so bright its gleam
all the earth floor he easily saw
and viewed all these vessels no vestige now
was seen of the serpent  the sword had ta'en him
then i heard the hill of its hoard was reft
old work of giants by one alone
he burdened his bosom with beakers and plate
at his own good will and the ensign took
brightest of beacons  the blade of his lord
 its edge was iron  had injured deep
one that guarded the golden hoard
many a year and its murder fire
spread hot round the barrow in horror billows
at midnight hour till it met its doom
hasted the herald the hoard so spurred him
his track to retrace he was troubled by doubt
high souled hero if haply he'd find
alive where he left him the lord of weders
weakening fast by the wall of the cave
so he carried the load his lord and king
he found all bleeding famous chief
at the lapse of life the liegeman again
plashed him with water till point of word
broke through the breast hoard beowulf spake
sage and sad as he stared at the gold
for the gold and treasure to god my thanks
to the wielder of wonders with words i say
for what i behold to heaven's lord
for the grace that i give such gifts to my folk
or ever the day of my death be run
now i've bartered here for booty of treasure
the last of my life so look ye well
to the needs of my land no longer i tarry
a barrow bid ye the battle fanned raise
for my ashes 'twill shine by the shore of the flood
to folk of mine memorial fair
on hrones headland high uplifted
that ocean wanderers oft may hail
beowulf's barrow as back from far
they drive their keels o'er the darkling wave
from his neck he unclasped the collar of gold
valorous king to his vassal gave it
with bright gold helmet breastplate and ring
to the youthful thane  bade him use them in joy
thou art end and remnant of all our race
the waegmunding name for wyrd hath swept them
all my line to the land of doom
earls in their glory  i after them go
this word was the last which the wise old man
harbored in heart ere hot death waves
of balefire he chose from his bosom fled
his soul to seek the saints' reward





it was heavy hap for that hero young
on his lord beloved to look and find him
lying on earth with life at end
sorrowful sight but the slayer too
awful earth dragon empty of breath
lay felled in fight nor fain of its treasure
could the writhing monster rule it more
for edges of iron had ended its days
hard and battle sharp hammers' leaving {37a}
and that flier afar had fallen to ground
hushed by its hurt its hoard all near
no longer lusty aloft to whirl
at midnight making its merriment seen
proud of its prizes  prone it sank
by the handiwork of the hero king
forsooth among folk but few achieve
 though sturdy and strong as stories tell me
and never so daring in deed of valor
the perilous breath of a poison foe
to brave and to rush on the ring board hall
whenever his watch the warden keeps
bold in the barrow beowulf paid
the price of death for that precious hoard
and each of the foes had found the end
of this fleeting life
befell erelong
that the laggards in war the wood had left
trothbreakers cowards ten together
fearing before to flourish a spear
in the sore distress of their sovran lord
now in their shame their shields they carried
armor of fight where the old man lay
and they gazed on wiglaf wearied he sat
at his sovran's shoulder shieldsman good
to wake him with water {37b} nowise it availed
though well he wished it in world no more
could he barrier life for that leader of battles
nor baffle the will of all wielding god
doom of the lord was law o'er the deeds
of every man as it is to day
grim was the answer easy to get
from the youth for those that had yielded to fear
wiglaf spake the son of weohstan
mournful he looked on those men unloved
who sooth will speak can say indeed
that the ruler who gave you golden rings
and the harness of war in which ye stand
 for he at ale bench often times
bestowed on hall folk helm and breastplate
lord to liegemen the likeliest gear
which near of far he could find to give
threw away and wasted these weeds of battle
on men who failed when the foemen came
not at all could the king of his comrades in arms
venture to vaunt though the victory wielder
god gave him grace that he got revenge
sole with his sword in stress and need
to rescue his life 'twas little that i
could serve him in struggle yet shift i made
(hopeless it seemed) to help my kinsman
its strength ever waned when with weapon i struck
that fatal foe and the fire less strongly
flowed from its head  too few the heroes
in throe of contest that thronged to our king
now gift of treasure and girding of sword
joy of the house and home delight
shall fail your folk his freehold land
every clansman within your kin
shall lose and leave when lords high born
hear afar of that flight of yours
a fameless deed yea death is better
for liegemen all than a life of shame





that battle toil bade he at burg to announce
at the fort on the cliff where full of sorrow
all the morning earls had sat
daring shieldsmen in doubt of twain
would they wail as dead or welcome home
their lord beloved? little {38a} kept back
of the tidings new but told them all
the herald that up the headland rode
now the willing giver to weder folk
in death bed lies the lord of geats
on the slaughter bed sleeps by the serpent's deed
and beside him is stretched that slayer of men
with knife wounds sick  {38b} no sword availed
on the awesome thing in any wise
to work a wound there wiglaf sitteth
weohstan's bairn by beowulf's side
the living earl by the other dead
and heavy of heart a head watch {38c} keeps
o'er friend and foe  now our folk may look
for waging of war when once unhidden
to frisian and frank the fall of the king
is spread afar  the strife began
when hot on the hugas {38d} hygelac fell
and fared with his fleet to the frisian land
him there the hetwaras humbled in war
plied with such prowess their power o'erwhelming
that the bold in battle bowed beneath it
and fell in fight to his friends no wise
could that earl give treasure and ever since
the merowings' favor has failed us wholly
nor aught expect i of peace and faith
from swedish folk 'twas spread afar
how ongentheow reft at ravenswood
haethcyn hrethling of hope and life
when the folk of geats for the first time sought
in wanton pride the warlike scylfings
soon the sage old sire {38e} of ohtere
ancient and awful gave answering blow
the sea king {38f} he slew and his spouse redeemed
his good wife rescued though robbed of her gold
mother of ohtere and onela
then he followed his foes who fled before him
sore beset and stole their way
bereft of a ruler to ravenswood

with his host he besieged there what swords had left
the weary and wounded woes he threatened
the whole night through to that hard pressed throng
some with the morrow his sword should kill
some should go to the gallows tree
for rapture of ravens but rescue came
with dawn of day for those desperate men
when they heard the horn of hygelac sound
tones of his trumpet the trusty king
had followed their trail with faithful band





the bloody swath of swedes and geats
and the storm of their strife were seen afar
how folk against folk the fight had wakened
the ancient king with his atheling band
sought his citadel sorrowing much
ongentheow earl went up to his burg
he had tested hygelac's hardihood
the proud one's prowess would prove it no longer
defied no more those fighting wanderers
nor hoped from the seamen to save his hoard
his bairn and his bride  so he bent him again
old to his earth walls yet after him came
with slaughter for swedes the standards of hygelac
o'er peaceful plains in pride advancing
till hrethelings fought in the fenced town {39a}
then ongentheow with edge of sword
the hoary bearded was held at bay
and the folk king there was forced to suffer
eofor's anger in ire at the king
wulf wonreding with weapon struck
and the chieftain's blood for that blow in streams
flowed 'neath his hair no fear felt he
stout old scylfing but straightway repaid
in better bargain that bitter stroke
and faced his foe with fell intent
nor swift enough was the son of wonred
answer to render the aged chief
too soon on his head the helm was cloven
blood bedecked he bowed to earth
and fell adown not doomed was he yet
and well he waxed though the wound was sore
then the hardy hygelac thane {39b}
when his brother fell with broad brand smote
giants' sword crashing through giants' helm
across the shield wall  sank the king
his folk's old herdsman fatally hurt
there were many to bind the brother's wounds
and lift him fast as fate allowed
his people to wield the place of war
but eofor took from ongentheow
earl from other the iron breastplate
hard sword hilted and helmet too
and the hoar chief's harness to hygelac carried
who took the trappings and truly promised
rich fee 'mid folk  and fulfilled it so
for that grim strife gave the geatish lord
hrethel's offspring when home he came
to eofor and wulf a wealth of treasure
each of them had a hundred thousand {39c}
in land and linked rings nor at less price reckoned
mid earth men such mighty deeds
and to eofor he gave his only daughter
in pledge of grace the pride of his home

such is the feud the foeman's rage
death hate of men  so i deem it sure
that the swedish folk will seek us home
for this fall of their friends the fighting scylfings
when once they learn that our warrior leader
lifeless lies who land and hoard
ever defended from all his foes
furthered his folk's weal finished his course
a hardy hero  now haste is best
that we go to gaze on our geatish lord
and bear the bountiful breaker of rings
to the funeral pyre no fragments merely
shall burn with the warrior wealth of jewels
gold untold and gained in terror
treasure at last with his life obtained
all of that booty the brands shall take
fire shall eat it no earl must carry
memorial jewel no maiden fair
shall wreathe her neck with noble ring
nay sad in spirit and shorn of her gold
oft shall she pass o'er paths of exile
now our lord all laughter has laid aside
all mirth and revel many a spear
morning cold shall be clasped amain
lifted aloft nor shall lilt of harp
those warriors wake but the wan hued raven
fain o'er the fallen his feast shall praise
and boast to the eagle how bravely he ate
when he and the wolf were wasting the slain

so he told his sorrowful tidings
and little {39d} he lied the loyal man
of word or of work the warriors rose
sad they climbed to the cliff of eagles
went welling with tears the wonder to view
found on the sand there stretched at rest
their lifeless lord who had lavished rings
of old upon them ending day
had dawned on the doughty one death had seized
in woful slaughter the weders' king
there saw they besides the strangest being
loathsome lying their leader near
prone on the field the fiery dragon
fearful fiend with flame was scorched
reckoned by feet it was fifty measures
in length as it lay aloft erewhile
it had revelled by night and anon come back
seeking its den now in death's sure clutch
it had come to the end of its earth hall joys
by it there stood the stoups and jars
dishes lay there and dear decked swords
eaten with rust as on earth's lap resting
a thousand winters they waited there
for all that heritage huge that gold
of bygone men was bound by a spell {39e}
so the treasure hall could be touched by none
of human kind  save that heaven's king
god himself might give whom he would
helper of heroes the hoard to open
even such a man as seemed to him meet

a perilous path it proved he {40a} trod
who heinously hid that hall within
wealth under wall its watcher had killed
one of a few {40b} and the feud was avenged
in woful fashion wondrous seems it
what manner a man of might and valor
oft ends his life when the earl no longer
in mead hall may live with loving friends
so beowulf when that barrow's warden
he sought and the struggle himself knew not
in what wise he should wend from the world at last
for {40c} princes potent who placed the gold
with a curse to doomsday covered it deep
so that marked with sin the man should be
hedged with horrors in hell bonds fast
racked with plagues who should rob their hoard
yet no greed for gold but the grace of heaven
ever the king had kept in view {40d}
wiglaf spake the son of weohstan
at the mandate of one oft warriors many
sorrow must suffer and so must we
the people's shepherd showed not aught
of care for our counsel king beloved
that guardian of gold he should grapple not urged we
but let him lie where he long had been
in his earth hall waiting the end of the world
the hest of heaven  this hoard is ours
but grievously gotten too grim the fate
which thither carried our king and lord
i was within there and all i viewed
the chambered treasure when chance allowed me
(and my path was made in no pleasant wise)
under the earth wall eager i seized
such heap from the hoard as hands could bear
and hurriedly carried it hither back
to my liege and lord alive was he still
still wielding his wits the wise old man
spake much in his sorrow and sent you greetings
and bade that ye build when he breathed no more
on the place of his balefire a barrow high
memorial mighty of men was he
worthiest warrior wide earth o'er
the while he had joy of his jewels and burg
let us set out in haste now the second time
to see and search this store of treasure
these wall hid wonders  the way i show you
where gathered near ye may gaze your fill
at broad gold and rings let the bier soon made
be all in order when out we come
our king and captain to carry thither
 man beloved  where long he shall bide
safe in the shelter of sovran god
then the bairn of weohstan bade command
hardy chief to heroes many
that owned their homesteads hither to bring
firewood from far  o'er the folk they ruled
for the famed one's funeral  fire shall devour
and wan flames feed on the fearless warrior
who oft stood stout in the iron shower
when sped from the string a storm of arrows
shot o'er the shield wall  the shaft held firm
featly feathered followed the barb
and now the sage young son of weohstan
seven chose of the chieftain's thanes
the best he found that band within
and went with these warriors one of eight
under hostile roof in hand one bore
a lighted torch and led the way
no lots they cast for keeping the hoard
when once the warriors saw it in hall
altogether without a guardian
lying there lost and little they mourned
when they had hastily haled it out
dear bought treasure the dragon they cast
the worm o'er the wall for the wave to take
and surges swallowed that shepherd of gems
then the woven gold on a wain was laden
countless quite  and the king was borne
hoary hero to hrones ness

then fashioned for him the folk of geats
firm on the earth a funeral pile
and hung it with helmets and harness of war
and breastplates bright as the boon he asked
and they laid amid it the mighty chieftain
heroes mourning their master dear
then on the hill that hugest of balefires
the warriors wakened wood smoke rose
black over blaze and blent was the roar
of flame with weeping (the wind was still)
till the fire had broken the frame of bones
hot at the heart in heavy mood
their misery moaned they their master's death
wailing her woe the widow {41a} old
her hair upbound for beowulf's death
sung in her sorrow and said full oft
she dreaded the doleful days to come
deaths enow and doom of battle
and shame  the smoke by the sky was devoured
the folk of the weders fashioned there
on the headland a barrow broad and high
by ocean farers far descried
in ten days' time their toil had raised it
the battle brave's beacon round brands of the pyre
a wall they built the worthiest ever
that wit could prompt in their wisest men
they placed in the barrow that precious booty
the rounds and the rings they had reft erewhile
hardy heroes from hoard in cave
trusting the ground with treasure of earls
gold in the earth where ever it lies
useless to men as of yore it was
then about that barrow the battle keen rode
atheling born a band of twelve
lament to make to mourn their king
chant their dirge and their chieftain honor
they praised his earlship his acts of prowess
worthily witnessed  and well it is
that men their master friend mightily laud
heartily love when hence he goes
from life in the body forlorn away

thus made their mourning the men of geatland
for their hero's passing his hearth companions
quoth that of all the kings of earth
of men he was mildest and most beloved
to his kin the kindest keenest for praise
